## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to study the presence of menstrual cycle irregularities before and
after COVID-19 vaccination. A focus on intermenstrual bleeding, commonly referred to as
spotting, will be the primary irregularity studied. Comparisons of intermenstrual bleeding before
and after vaccination will be analyzed to determine if significant changes are often experienced.
The conclusions of this study can help inform medical professionals, as well as people who
menstruate, the possible side effects of the vaccine on menstruation cycles. This can better
inform our general understanding of the COVID-19 vaccine and how each individual may react
to it.
