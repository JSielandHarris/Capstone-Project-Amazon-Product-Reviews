"Applephiles get a 4kTV and then buy this","Our house became Apple'fied a few years ago and the Apple TV box is pretty much central to that experience. If I have any complaint it's that I had just upgraded from a 3rd generation box to the 4th when this 4k version came out. Not a big deal until we upgraded to a 4k tv soon after, and then I had NO choice but to shell out the bucks for a 4k box! There are several in depth reviews here covering all the features so I won't repeat here other than to say you will need high speed internet and make sure you are using the proper HDMI cables (HDCP 2.2, ARC, HDMI 2.0, 18Gbit, etc.). Proper HDMI cables are a must or you won't get the best 4k has to offer ie; 4kHDR or DolbyVision at 60 Hz. Our particular setup is an LG 65"" LED/LCD 4kHDtv, Yamaha 4k pass through receiver and a 5.1 home theater speaker system. Peripherals include the AppleTV, Firestick and BluRay DVD player. Everything runs off high speed WiFi and everything communicates with each other perfectly. All the remotes automatically program to run each of the other devices including the Apple remote. At the end of the day 4k video is simply stunning, and I just don't see how they will improve upon it short of someday beaming signals straight to the cortex! If you're already in the Apple-verse, you know all you have to do is plug this thing in and it will set up virtually by itself. Just run the software updates and get the 4k settings where you want them. Couldn't be easier. Starting with the 4th generation box you can download apps from the App Store; many free and some paid. I don't do a lot of gaming but it has that capability. Frankly if you're here reading this then you probably already know what you want so I'll just close by saying get it. We recently cut the cord and the 4k Apple box along with an HD OTA antenna is central to that goal. We couldn't be happier.EDIT 1: A few months have gone by and all good. Wanted to update by informing that my LG tv has some of the same apps as the Apple Box and I find they are much more stable using the Apple device. YouTubetv in particular can be wonky when using the LG app, but works perfectly on ATV. Just one more bonus point!EDIT 2: There are a whole lot of comments under my post that seem fake to me. IDK if that's Amazon or Apple or who is responsible but it's pretty lame. Makes it seem like a scam product which of course Apple products are anything but. 2 years using this box and all good. I like it as much as when I first got it. Ignore all these b.s. filler comments below.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2018","T. Shepard",1
"Yay, no more buffering!","We own about 3 different models of Rokus and an Amazon Fire. They all suffer from the same malady -- constant buffering. This will make you want to yank it out of the wall and toss it out the window during a critical football game or the best part of your favorite show. The Apple TV blows them away IMO. It is extremely fast and no more buffering issues. Certainly pricier than other options, but well worth saving up your pennies to get this!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2018","David Michaels",1
"A Flexible Box which Can Deliver Stunning Content","Who should buy an Apple TV 4K?Do you have a 4K TV, with HDR support? Do you have an over 30 Mb/s Internet connection? Is your primary mobile platform iOS? Do you have a significant amount of content purchased via iTunes? If so, I think you will find the Apple TV to be a competently, and occasionally gratifyingly executed streamer which benefits from the strong iOS ecosystem. If not, then some other, cheaper, device will probably serve you better.I've owned every generation of the Apple TV, from the original silver box, and the 4K is the main streamer attached to my 4K TV, an LG OLED55B7. I've owned this particular Apple TV for 3 months at this writing, time enough to give it a proper review.32GB vs 64GBAs content is almost uniformly streamed (although you can get limited DVR apps), any excess space would be for large asset games. I bought the 64GB version, but that was for future proofing. Most people will be just as happy with the 32GB version.Delivering High Quality Video ContentAs an owner of hundreds of iTunes hosted movies, I was happy with Apple when they announced that not only would 4K material be sold without a price premium, but existing purchases would be upgraded to 4K at no additional cost. Older movies I had purchased such as The Princess Bride, or the James Bond movies have started showing up as 4K content. Combined with tvOS settings to match content frame rate, and HDR settings, older movies are much improved especially when HDR is captured. The black levels and popping colors of older film movies, along with the loss of frame conversion judder can result in a nearly transformative viewing experience. On the downside, telling the TV to switch display mode does result in a frustrating couple seconds of black screen as any video playback both begins and ends.If your TV supports HDR, the improvement in catalog titles—movies I’ve seen many times—can be startling. I did not expect movies like Ghostbusters (1984) to be as fresh looking.As my TV supports Dolby Vision, and newish iTunes movies are typically encoded with that advanced HDR format, I am prepared for a treat when I see the Dolby Vision tag appear on my screen. Modern movies so encoded, like La La Land, make me wonder if it's even possible for the human eye to see a better picture. If you have a new OLED, you really have to try it out.Out of curiosity, I purchased the UHD Blu-ray version of Justice League with HDR, and compared it to the iTunes 4K Dolby Vision version. I wanted to find out what I was missing with streaming level quality. While I had the nagging feeling the disc version was somehow cleaner, there was no discernible difference between the two versions as I switched back and forth. Both looked great. Plus, there is a scene midway through the movie where my UHD Blu-ray player locks up leading me to learn that scrubbing through a movie on my Apple TV is much faster than my LG UHD player. For me, the convenience and lower cost of online movies outstrips any barely perceptible quality improvement, and I'm unlikely to buy a UHD disc again.At this writing, I have 30 MBit fiber service to the house and 4K movies start streaming within a few seconds most every time and have only paused for buffering a handful of times in months of active use.Some apps require updates. For example, I use an over the air DVR app (MythTV) which shows signs of poor frame rate conversions and horrible color matching while using the content matching settings. The same 1080i content looks great when played via my TVs built in DLNA app. I hope this gets updated soon.Dolby AtmosWith tvOS 12, Apple delivers on its promise to bring the high end audio system Dolby Atmos to many, specially encoded, movies. As I'm that kind of person, I spent a Sunday crawling through my attic installing a pair of affordable ceiling speakers, and wiring them into my (compatible) AV receiver. It's a nice improvement, but not a spectacular one. Whereas the effect as demonstrated by the Dolby demo app on my LG TV shows what's possible with height speakers, actual movies tend to have subtle effects. I've listened to several Atmos encoded iTunes movies: Lego Batman, Ready Player One, Spiderman: Homecoming, Justice League, Earth: One Amazing Day and I enjoyed the immersive sound track, but the actual amount of sound coming out of the ceiling speakers is often small: often just the background music or a bit of an echo. Is it an improvement? Yes. Am I happy I spent $120 and an afternoon cutting into my ceiling? Yes. Has its spectacular-ness changed my perception of cinema? No. It's just a nice value add.As an App PlatformApple has made it easy to bring iOS apps to the tvOS platform, the large majority of the code for my own app runs unmodified on both platforms. So there is no technical reason for developers to avoid the tvOS platform; however there hasn't exactly been a gold rush, and some corporate goals clash. For instance, you will not see the highest possible quality YouTube content because of a disagreement between Apple and Google over the VP9 codec, and it took years for Amazon to finally bring (a fairly mediocre) version of their Prime Video app. I can report, however, that the Apple TV version of the Amazon Prime Video app does not skip audio like the version embedded in my TV, while still delivering stunning images as illustrated by the beautiful cars rolling throughout The Grand Tour. Wow.I've been happy with the collection of video streaming apps: Hulu, Netflix, iTunes, Amazon Video, VRV, and SlingTV are all serviceable, as well as local area streamers such as the live TV ""Channels"" and Tablo DVR apps which pull content from devices on my network. It's good that more and more services are allowing their content to be gathered into the centralized TV; app; I don't have to spend my time looking through different apps for content. People with content purchased on Amazon, Vudu or Google Play can create a Movies Anywhere account, download the free app and watch non-iTunes content on the Apple TV (and even get a few free movies in the process).As a Game MachineMany games are available, my family is particularly fond of Just Dance which makes use of the accelerometer on the Siri remote, and I have a couple gamepads that make games like Asphalt 8 tolerable. However, the Apple TV has not become a competitive gaming destination when compared to PlayStation or XboxThe RemoteThe remote is flimsy and sometime irritating when it comes to simple actions like showing closed captions. It's deficiencies are the primary reason I gave this streamer 4 instead of 5 stars. It works most of the time, and if you get into the habit of having Siri do things for you, can be fun. At least the 4K version of this remote makes it visually easier to tell what end is which via the simple affordance of a white ring around the menu button. The volume buttons are my favorite feature of the remote: they work with everything I've thrown at it: my receiver, the speakers inside my TV, various Bluetooth headphones...One of my favorite features is using Siri to turn off HomeKit enabled devices. So just before bed, I'll tell it to turn off the basement lights or power down the AC in the guest room.Interfacing with Other DevicesI have a new Yamaha 4K Home Theatre Receiver and I've been happy with how waking the Apple TV will wake the receiver and wake the TV over HDMI, and how the TV remote can control the Apple TV, again via HDMI. It makes a universal remote much less desirable. I've also been happy with using easily paired Bluetooth headphones to listen at night. This, I think, is superior to the wired connection one would find on the Roku remote. However, my TV also supports Bluetooth headphone pairing, which is even better as then I can hear all the sounds, not just those coming out of the Apple TV. Inexpensive Bluetooth keyboards can be paired, making searches and password entry much easier or even better use the iPhone remote app. (HDMI integration has also worked with the new Denon and Sony receivers I've tried.)For a while, I was connecting the Apple TV directly to the HDMI port in my TV and bringing sound into my receiver via ARC, but I eventually found that using a shorter (1 ft) quality HDMI cable allowed me to connect the Apple TV to my receiver and still be able to display Dolby Vision content without sparkles or lip syncing issues. Finally, a 1 cable to the TV solution.I am an advocate of devices, like this one, which have Ethernet ports, as I believe in the old adage that if you have a wire, you don't have a problem. Still, it does support modern WiFi if needed.If you want to get deep into the Apple ecosystem, an Apple TV can act as the central hub of the HomeKit home automation environment. Thus, I can remotely manage light switches, fans, control my thermostat, and find out the temperature of a variety of rooms from my iPhone.And ancient AirPlay is surprisingly useful for quickly bringing up content, such as sharing a YouTube video from your phone. I've taken to reading my son's computer class homework via Airplay where we can both comfortably read it on the big screen while he's editing it on his Mac laptop.ReliabilityThe current version of tvOS has been exceptionally reliable but occasionally apps will have to be restarted. Certainly not every day or every week but sometimes.Versus Previous VersionsThis contains a better processor than the Apple TV 4, but I can't say that it is any smoother than what was already smooth, and if you don't have a 4K TV with HDR, you will likely not notice better video quality. Functionally, the Apple TV 4 works just like the 4K. Older generations beyond that, are showing their age and I find that the 3rd generation is laggy and the 2nd generation is crashy. The 4K no longer has a USB port, so for app development, you'd best get used to remote debugging.SummaryI like the Apple TV 4K. I wish Apple didn't price it like an Apple product, but I use it everyday in many ways, and it does everything I want from a streamer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2017","Glenn R.

"Best streaming device yet!","By far the best apple tv yet. The picture is unbelievably clear (and I don't even have a 4K TV). Really, really easy to set up. It links to your iPhone or iPad so you can use it to type in passwords etc during setup. I also have several Roku boxes and am now back to Apple TV - much better than ever!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2018","TexasGirl",1
"I am John Wick using AppleTV 4K.","I generally used to regard the Apple brand as one of higher quality and integrity, but had never actually owned an Apple product. The fact that this product passed all of Apple's various stages of quality control and user experience testing to make it to market is incredible to me. I was going to wait until I had the chance to thoroughly test for all accolades and problems, but the list of problems grew inversely w/ my patience retention, so I had to stop collating and get to the review.= THE REMOTE =This remote needs no introduction. It is the spawn of Satan. It's the work of evil. After 30 minutes of trying to use this remote, you will look around the room for hidden cameras and pranksters watching from dark corners, and swear this remote is not for real and that you're being set up. You have read others' reviews- this remote is for real... in a bad, bad way.Handling the remote is like handling a venus flytrap. If you don't exercise an EXTREME AMOUNT OF CAUTION when touching, reaching for, picking up, or holding said venus flytrap, you will be bitten!! You WILL invariably and unintendedly activate something, go back, end app, skip something, bring up some weird menu, or trigger something bizarre, and you will have ONE RANDOM CHANCE IN 20 to undo it w/ out losing your place in whatever app you're in (streaming is H to the E to the double-bars). That's because the top 1/3 of the remote is a TOUCHPAD!! Apple made a remote out of a venus flytrap!! This remote sucks and the GUI that Apple has developed around it is ßeta at best. Over the last 10 years, we've all seen other companies /try/ to execute the touchpad remote (Panasonic), but Apple looks to embrace it fully and it unfortunately looks like the future of Apple remotes....but let's say you *lose* the venus flytrap. I know. Not Apple's fault. Can't blame Apple for that... or CAN'T I!?! Just LOOK at the number of people that have lost this... INCREDIBLY SMALL, CHEAP, THIN, SLITHERY piece of plastic! It must be in the millions by now! But, let's say you lose it. You pull out your iPhone and dial up the AppleTV app to control your AppleTV… brilliant! Except... the fooking app doesn't authenticate to the AppleTV directly via Bluetooth- it authenticates over the network! A lot of good THAT does you when you need the remote to type the password to get on the network. [FAIL]= USER EXPERIENCE =The user experience needs no contributions from the venus flytrap to be horrific. Most of my user experience has been restricted to MLB. Which, to that, you could say, ""if you have problems with the MLB app, that is MLB's fault, not Apple's, right?"" Wrong. I've seen MLB on the PC, PS3 (no longer supported), smartphone, and Roku. Hands down, AppleTV royally gets an 'F' for MLB streaming. Ultimately, Apple has accepted MLB's streaming solution and put it into their product... Apple's problem.1. On every other platform, ""next"" in MLB is a 30-second skip forward or jump to next half of inning. On AppleTV- it's 10s of FF. I have to push the 'next' button TWELVE TIMES to get to the next half of inning. {sigh} That would be slightly acceptable IF IT ACTUALLY SKIPPED FORWARD 10 SECONDS. No. Sometimes, it skips 5 seconds, sometimes not at all. I'm sitting there for 60 seconds pushing next next next next next… to get thru 2 minutes of the same gd commercials I've seen 500x now from unsuccessfully attempting to jump to next half of inning. [FAIL]2. I turn ""HIDE SCORES"" ON. I DON'T WANT TO SEE THE SCORES, MAN! Next time I wake up the AppleTV to watch a game, ALL THE SCORES ARE SHOWING! thx, AppleTV. I have gotten used to holding my hand over my eyes so that I can see only the top menu and scrolling through the venus flytrap menus with my venus flytrap to turn HIDE SCORES back ON. Sometimes, the scores /will actually be hidden/, but while I'm clicking thru venus flytrap menus trying to find my game in the calendar- POW - all the scores will appear. thx, AppleTV.3. Using venus flytrap menus, I click enter on the top of the 1st inning... and it brings up top of 3rd inning, showing current score and everything. thx, AppleTV. Did I do something wrong? I go back. All the way back. Restart AppleTV. Bring up game navigating venus flytrap menus, click on top of 1st inning... top of 3rd shows up. Come on!! I actually have to start game from very beginning of ALL commercials and pre-game that I have already seen 10x now, and magically slide venus flytrap remote slider from 0:00:00 to the unknown starting time of top of first inning using tiny thumbnails as my guide that sometimes show up, sometimes do not.4. I navigate the venus flytrap menus to my game, press enter, and it starts playing the game from 2 days prior. Or 1 day later. Or a different team! Wha? Did I do something wrong?? I go back. And right before I click enter on my game, date/matchup randomly changes to a different one. Sometimes, AppleTV shows me ""NO GAMES SCHEDULED"" and I'm thinking... uh, no games scheduled on a Sunday? Wrong. On a Friday?? Wrong.5. Commercials. Oh, man. What AppleTV and MLB appears to be doing is pushing commercials dynamically between innings. What this does is forces me to watch 5 minutes of commercials in between innings that I *KNOW* from being at the ballpark only last 2 minutes. And- if I try to FF, everything will either freeze or start playing from a random point in the game that is completely different than what the timeline shows! Wha?? If I try to drag the venus flytrap slider to the beginning of next inning and accidentally (VERY EASY TO DO!!) drop it just a touch in the 'commercial' timeframe, it starts all the commercials over from the very beginning and forces playback of all. This is COMPLETE rubbish!! This does not happen on ANY OTHER PLATFORM!! This reason alone is worth avoiding AppleTV.6. What's the first thing any techie support person will ask you when you're having problems w/ your device... ""Have you restarted the device?"" To restart this flipping unit, I have to scroll, click, glide, back, etc. ad nauseam. Or crawl into the cabinet and unplug the unit from power. Given the frequency of problems this piece of junk encounters, there should be a ""RESTART"" option when I hold down the button that brings up the ""SLEEP"" option. Instead, Apple wants you to 'enjoy' the navigational experience of venus flytrap (remote) and venus flytrap menus.= BOTTOM LINE =It would be impossible to oversell this product's terribleness. This is my first AppleTV, so I do not have other models to compare to nor do I have helpful advice on alternative AppleTV models to purchase. My recommendation would be to at least stay away from the AppleTV 4K model if not go with a Roku unit altogether. I have seen the Roku, I have used the Roku, and I prefer the Roku. So does everyone else in my family. I just had to be different. About 50% of the time, I am unable to watch a game w/out seriously wanting to smash this AppleTV on the concrete and enjoy the explosion of AppleTV inerts. I am John Wick using AppleTV.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2018","Angry Llama",1
"Ignore the following warning at your peril!","WARNING - Conduct an exorcism on the remote before attempting to use it. Once that’s done you may continue.Its slender form makes it a very attractive device. It also makes it very hard to hold steady when pressing the home button. That tiny bump at the top end of the remote requires just enough pressure to use so that it also makes it very easy to have the whole remote move in your hand and inadvertently brush the the black glass touch-activated section that makes up the top third of the remote. That, in turn, causes a variety of other operations to take place that then require some time to recover before taking another stab at the home button.The setup of the AppleTV 4K is largely left to the imagination. That’s especially true because of the near total lack of documentation. What there is comes from third party You Tube videos and the like.Voice recognition is a hit-or-miss affair but that’s true of Apple products in general (We have a house full of them.)The main chip in the Apple TV 4K is very fast and allows the user to make a remarkable number of mistakes in a very short time.In the end, the Apple TV 4K is cursed by its over-design. It is trying to do too many jobs at once and getting tangled in its shorts. for example, it wants to collect all the channels that exist on the TV regardless of source. In the end a well intentioned assembly of information becomes an unholy mess.I admit to being totally spoiled after several years of living with Roku devices that do come with documentation that one rarely uses because they are truly intuitive and do essentially one job and do it exceedingly well. I strongly recommend the Roku Streaming Stick + and the Roku Ultra.

"Best Streamer On The Market (Even After Switching Over From Amazon Fire)","I had the Apple 2 TV, moved to Fire TV for two years, now I’m back to Apple with the 4K. Very happy with Apple. The Fire TV’s screen layout and controller drove me nuts. I love the layout of the Apple unit. Have not switched back to Fire even though I can.People say the Apple controller is bad because it’s sensitive. That is true. Very easy to bump and screw up what you’re watching. However, the input is faster with Apple. Plus, the voice text feature works inside specific fields, not just globally. Fire doesn’t do that. If, you’re in the YouTube app and want to voice something in instead of typing (scrolling), it uses the global feature and you get everything as a result: apps, songs, movies, etc. This takes you out of the app. With Apple, the voice texting stays inside the app to get results. 80% of the time I just talk-text and find stuff. It's way better than Alexa (however, it won't answer random questions like Alexa does).The controller is very thin, light, and slick. It falls right out of your hand. I highly advice you to get the elago R1 Intelli Case for like $12. It's a silicon no-slip, matte case that has a tiny lanyard and hidden magnets. (We stick it to our giant lamp post.) This gives it more substance and it won't fall through your hands. Get it in blue or black (the red is hideous).If you like, you can connect the unit to your iPad or iPhone. This is super handy since you can speed text everything.The unit itself is fast. Unlike the newest Fire TV dongle, it has an Ethernet port. And something I’ve missed is Airplay. I can send videos to play on my tv from my iPhone or iPad. (Anything with a video in your browser like Youtube or Vimeo.) Fire never allowed this.No, it does not have Atmos Dolby, but we just have a sound bar: good enough. No Amazon Music or Spotify, but the former is limited by song selection ad the latter has too many commercials. No loss there.I do miss having a browser: Apple doesn't have one. Kindle Fire has another cool feature I miss. When you look for a show or movie, it shows you several places where to watch it (different apps or stations). With Apple, it always sends you to their store to buy or rent it. It's all about using their ecosystem to get one last sale out of you. But, if you did buy a lot of stuff to keep, at least you have plenty of space to store it on Apple. You get hardly any space on Kindle Fire.One feature I like that's not on Amazon Fire is the home/tv button. It automatically creates a list of recent shows you watch that have a new unplayed episode. You have to have the tv app downloaded (nbc, cbs, etc), but if you watch a show once it adds the unplayed ones to the Up Next list. You can take them off this list too. Unfortunately, this feature does not work with Netflix. However, this shows you what you can watch without checking every single station. Brilliant.The Amazon Prime Video app is available, so not much the Fire has over the Apple. Apple’s features plus 32G make this great. And remember, Fire TV is trying to be cost-effective. You get what you pay for. Apple TV is fast and visually elegant. The Dynamic Cards (the layout) is so great for the user. Lots of pull-down info on every show. It's just very functional and beautiful. It's 100% Apply style!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2018","P.W.A.",1
"An amazing upgrade, it does it all if you are an Apple user","I couldn't be happier with the new upgrade. I had a 3rd generation Apple TV which was slow (buffered a lot), and lacked Amazon Prime video (wouldn't accept the new OS update). I thought I was only upgrading for some better speed, but had no idea what a huge update this was. Setup was super easy, it sync'd with my iPhone and used all my apple account settings. The siri remote is better than I expected, it was nice to use voice for passwords and logins instead of typing. And, if your iPhone or iPad is in range, you can use that keyboard for typing on the Apple TV.If you are an Apple ecosystem user, this is a must have. If you aren't an Apple user (iCloud, iPhone, etc), it probably isn't worth the extra money, just go with a Roku or Amazon product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2018","Daedalus",1

"Nine Reasons to Future-Proof with Apple TV 4K. Its top-of-the-line!","WOW! I could not believe how much better this version of Apple TV is. I have used the first two versions...merely OK. This one is well-thoughout and works great. Here are the reasons why I like it:1) I can get all of my favorite apps, which right now are Amazon Prime, Hulu, and GAIA. All the rest are available too.2) This version is 4K and works well with my new LG OLED 4K set and the Apple TV supports Dolby Vision, the top end of video quality. I'm getting great resolution so that I can go up to the set and find NO pixels when the video is 4K.3) I have a lot of Apple devices and I can show what is on my iPhone or iPad directly on the set at full resolution and do it easily with built-in apps.4) This version of the Apple TV can handle a lot of apps and it remembers all of the log-ins, so I don't have to remember them. I can just fire it up and go straight to the content.5) The remote doesn't navigate with up and down buttons, it uses a touchpad top. You swipe up or down and push in to select. Its faster and intuitive after you get used to it.6) There is a voice button that you can push and get stuff done. I have used it to turn closed captioning off and on and find apps. I haven't tried to use it to get content, but that might be possible.7) The remote pairs with your TV or my A/V receiver and I can turn the volume up or down.8) I like the setting where you can prevent the sound from booming when you change the channels. There is a setting to tick to clip loud sound, which is good always. We don't like to be ""blown away"" with loud sound, which our system is capable of and old steamers would allow.9) I feel future-proofed. It will be a while before all video is in Dolby-Vision!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2018","Ray K",2
"Great 4K picture & sound - My concerns have been resolved","Since I returned the first AppleTV 4K, the replacement unit has worked flawlessly. The interface is excellent & easy to use. The quality of the video content is first-rate & the audio is stunning. I added front height speakers to enable Dolby Atmos sound from my system. It is truly amazing to hear. If you've been thinking about adding Atmos speakers, wait no longer. You won't believe the improvement in sound.So, my original grade of 3 stars has been moved up to 5 stars. It is another excellent product from Apple.I love all things Apple. I have 2 iPhones (my wife & I), a MacBook Pro, an Apple TV3 in my bedroom & an Apple TV 4K in the living room. Unfortunately, I had to return my first Apple TV 4K. I experienced what many buyers of the ATV 4K have - the picture would flicker off & then back on occasionally. This would continue for a while & then the next time the ATV would go off, the video never came back on even though the audio would continue to play. Nothing could fix this except to unplug the ATV to do a hard reboot. The whole process would then start again.I received my second ATV 4K 2 days ago. So far, this unit has performed as it should. Until I have proof that this unit won't start doing the same thing, I can't give the ATV 4K more than 3 stars.When it is working, the picture & sound are fantastic. I thought 4K, UHD, and/or DolbyVision were primarily improvements in video quality. But, wow - the audio improvement may be more dramatic than the video improvement. I love there ATV 4K when it works. It produces excellent video & audio. Apple needs to determine what is causing so many of their units to cut out. Apple recommends using a particular Belkin cable to ensure proper data transfer.

Love the Siri support directly from the remote.Picture and audio quality are equally as good. I have an Nvidia Shield as well, but the Apple TV is noticeably better in both the visuals and audio (when connected to a 4K HDR compatible TV). Especially when playing music, there's no comparison between the two.HDMI CEC support is present as well, so you can turn on and off your TV directly from the Apple TV's remote.Truly an excellent product, wish I had bought it sooner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2018","Customer",2
"Better than I thought","I really love this little thing for what it does, it takes a little getting used to but I'm gonna highlight the things I love the most and found to be the greatest parts of this piece of tech below this first paragraph. Overall I absolutely loved what this has allowed me to be able to do, I have used Netflix and the like for years via a gaming platform and currently I've been using an Xbox One X for my daily needs and my TV is a Samsung Curved 55 inches 4K Smart LED TV. Now I can seamlessly watch literally anything on my TV while incorporating 5.1 surround sound and that's what it's all about.-Setup was hilariously easy, you're just plugging in three cables (power, internet, HDMI) then you can breeze through setup with your Iphone or just the remote. If you're an Apple nerd and have the phones too you'll be able to use that to help speed setup, and to use as a keyboard.-Then there's the remote!!!! Saw there was some argument on the merits of the remote but it feels great, it is rechargeable via the same cable as the iphone (cable included with apple tv.) But the best feature though? As I was going through the settings I realized it would control the volume of the AMP I have for the surround sound!! This is a minor thing in the grand scheme but having that built into one controller without having to locate my brand of AMP and do a setup or really anything I just checked a box and boom!-I bought this to be able to watch movies from my laptop to my TV easier because when I upgraded my TV it no longer smoothly input movies via the HDMI cable through the TV or through the AMP so I thought the Apple TV might be the answer. After playing around with different ways to do this I figured out it's 100% the answer and there is multiple ways to do it! You can add movies to itunes and then access them through the Apple TV or you can airplay your macbook or iphone (if applicable) to your apple tv and thus to your TV.-For those looking for a solution to their Smart TV's internal operating systems and are considering this and something like a firestick, it really comes down to what you need it for and how much you're willing to spend. If you want something with a host of uses and lots of functionality i'd go Apple TV but if you just need something simple to add one and take with you I'd go firestick-Like most if not all Apple products this one works the best if you have one or more in the suite to help aid in the setup and controls. The Macbook will talk to it via Itunes and anything you play via Airplay which is helpful when you're trying to play videos or music through your TV. The iphone is by far the most helpful for day to day use as it can double as a remote to pause and acesss menus, as well as double as a keyboard while performing any sort of search or typing input (like entering emails for Netflix account signup etc)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2018","Trent",2
"Apple does it again! Best streaming device you can buy has everything!!!","The media could not be loaded.
 Apple makes high quality products that are expensive but that are platinum in their durability, features, style, and every other word you can think of when it comes to an A+ product. The Apple TV 4K device is no different. Light years better than the previous generation Apple TV 1080p.

The weight: The Apple TV 4K weights about 45 grams. The reason it's so heavy is because it houses hardware that allows it to bring you 4K content. Its still small enough to put on your entertainment center though.

Apps: It doesn't come with your standard apps Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, Disney Plus etc installed. You have to go into the App Store and download them which only takes a second. But it has every app you can think of. Apps that I can't find on my LG OLED TV.

What it supports: It supports 1080P HD at a resolution of 1980x1080, 4K at a resolution of 3840x2160, HDR 10, HDR 10+, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos. Here is important information about the resolution of the Apple TV 4K. I have the default interface at Dolby Vision 4K @ 60 Hz which looks amazing. Lets say you want to watch a movie in HD on HBO Max or Netflix, it will automatically transfer Dolby Vision to that HD title because you have the default dynamic range at Dolby Vision. To fix this, go to Video/Audio, Match Content, and make sure Match Dynamic Range and Match Frame Rate are turned on! I explain how to do this in a video I posted.

The Siri Remote: The invisible track pad is really what makes this remote top notch. Its smooth, doesn't lag, and if you're watching a movie or show, if you hold down on the trackpad it will tell you what time that show will be over as well as the standard timer.

Light and Dark Mode and the Apple TV remote in IOS: Light and Dark mode on my MacBook and iPhone is a great feature but I was wondering when it was coming to the Apple TV. Apple has implemented it in TV os. This was a great idea. I have it set where the interface becomes light in the day and dark at nice. Also, I'm so glad Apple implemented the Apple TV remote in iOS. The Apple TV remote app used to give me all kinds of issues and it would rarely get updated.

Overall this device is way better than the Roku Ultra and I tested both devices. I'm going to conclude with this. Never rely on apps built into your smart tv. Get an Apple TV 4K streaming device. 1. You get Dolby Atmos via hdmi and you don't get Dolby Atmos through your smart TV apps 2. Apps rarely update though smart TVs but you don't have that problem with an Apple TV 4K. It updates often, and you don't have to worry about your apps crashing either.

"I'm very unhappy with this product.","I have had nothing but problems with this Apple TV. I had trouble getting it installed and getting it to work. I've talked to Apple support at least 4 different times. Each time they have tried to help me but each time I have run into another problem. Their latest solution is that either I send it into them and be without my TV for 7 - 10 business days or take it to my local store which is 15 miles from my home. The ONLY appointments I can get are during rush hour. Then I would have to reinstall the whole thing over again. For my own sanity and blood pressure, I finally decided to try Amazon fire stick. I installed it in less than 15 minutes and have had no problems. Now I find out I can't return the Apple TV because I missed the return window (which also makes me unhappy). I've wasted $199 that I don't have to waste. If I could give a minus 10, this product would get it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2018","margeride",2
"Best Streaming Device I've Ever Used Yet!","Of all the streaming devices I've used in my life such as the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K, Roku Ultra, Nvidia Shield TV, Google Chromecast 2020, and now this Apple TV 4K, I personally find the Apple TV 4K to be the absolute best streaming device out of all of the aforementioned devices! The Apple TV 4K has a really clean & very intuitive UI, better Dolby Vision and Atmos support across apps than any other streamer out there, great streaming quality overall, stronger app library compared to other devices out there, and a pretty good remote. Yes you heard me, I actually dig this remote after getting used to it, I don't find it to be as overly complicated to use as some folks made it out to be.Hard to believe I used to be anti-Apple everything and even refused to buy this until much earlier this month and now I really see the hype surrounding the Apple TV 4K. Glad I did bit the bullet & purchased this. Also I now prefer iTunes as my preferred digital streaming service over Vudu and Amazon Video due to higher bitrate overall and of course better 4K Dolby Vision and/or Atmos support depending on movie. If you got almost $200 to spend for a streaming device, I highly recommend the Apple TV 4K!5/5I reviewed the 32GB version of this device, and it should be good enough for most people unless you plan on doing some gaming as well, then you might wanna go ahead and spend the extra $20 for the 64GB version.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2021","Cameron",2
"Pricey, but well worth the price tag","I own just about every streaming device there is: FireTV, Roku, smart TVs, etc. Apple TV is far away the best especially if you own multiple Apple products such as an iPhone and iPad. It syncs will all of your Apple devices and makes switching between them seamless.As if that weren't enough, apps like Hulu, Netflix, HBOMax, and Disney+, work better here than on other devices. Even the Prime Video app is better developed and is more intuitive than on its native device FireTV. And if you're like me, you have a TV streaming service instead of cable or satellite. I use YouTube TV and the biggest problem I had was finding a device that carries the app that isn't Google owned. Amazon can't come to an agreement with Google so there's no telling when or if it will ever be available there. So I purchased a Roku stick just to stream my YouTube TV, and it's interface is extremely clunky, buggy and in sore need of an operational overhaul.The Apple TV doesn't suffer from any of these issues. Yes, it's pricey, but it eliminates the need for any other device and the ease of use and intuitiveness of the operating system make it well worth the price tag in my opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2020","T.

"Expensive, yes. Still my favorite streaming box? Of course","The media could not be loaded.
 I have two Apple TV 4K models, both 32gb each. I bought the first one at Target in September 2019 after owning an Apple TV 3rd gen for 6 years.

This second Apple TV 4K was bought for a pretty stupid reason: Apple Fitness+ and Apple's unwillingness to let us AirPlay Fitness+ to even HomeKit enabled TVs.

This wasn't a purchase I was going to make when I bought the 4K TV in my bedroom; it is $180 so I bought a $50 Fire Stick for streaming for the bedroom TV.

But as I lose weight and get into better shape by monitoring what I eat, going into a caloric deficit, and exercising with Fitness+, the lack of AirPlay for that service meant I needed to get another Apple TV 4K.

Could I have just used the Apple TV in my living room? Sure, but the hardwood and floor level blinds make me leery of doing so. Exercising in my bedroom is my preferred way to do things as there is carpet.

Now, how does it perform? How does it stack up to my (now no longer owned) Fire Stick 4K?

The interface is buttery smooth on this box. It was smooth on the Fire Stick as well, but I had more internet connection errors on the Fire Stick. I have a mesh wifi system with one beacon outside in the utility closet, which is close to my bedroom, and one in my office. For whatever reason, sometimes the Fire Stick would tell me I didn't have an internet connection but my Apple TV in the living room did.

The interface on the Apple TV is just better. Full stop. It's clean, the UX is better even if it isn't the greatest it's still decent and easier to navigate than the Fire Stick.

Voice control with Siri is hit or miss for most people. Depending on what I am asking for, Siri will either find it or give me some convoluted nonsense. The Fire Stick was a bit better but not by much. Where Apple pulls ahead in the voice assistant feature of the streaming box wars is being able to search across multiple apps and services, something I sorely missed when when using Alexa on my Fire Stick.

The resolution is great; I have two 4K TVs from LG, with HDR and HomeKit, one 49"" in the living room and a 43"" in the bedroom mounted to the wall. The picture may vary from TV to TV but I find it incredibly sharp. One thing to note is with this box you need an HDMI 2.0 cable that is able to handle 4K data streaming to actually get the best picture.

I use mainly streaming services and keep my TV provider for sports and ID channel (yeah I am one of those women haha) and this means I can, and do, use my HomePods for stereo sound, now coming with Dolby Atmos.

I recently bought a HomePod Mini for the bedroom Apple TV which sounds great. In order to use HomePods as default speakers for your Apple TV, you need two in a pair. If not, you can always press and hold the TV button on the remote to bring up AirPlay menu and select your HomePod.

The biggest, and I mean BIGGEST flaw of this box is the remote. OH. GOD. It's terrible. You accidentally touch the touch surface and you scrub through a video by accident. Scrolling down long lists of YouTube channels takes FOREVER whereas on my Fire Stick remote it was BANG BANG, down the list, as that remote has physical buttons. A big miss here by Apple.

All in all, as someone with an ENORMOUS cadre of Apple gear, this is another win from Apple.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2021","Tiffany White",2
"Really Nice TV companion","I love this thing.I love the remote after getting used to it. It’s so effortless. I love holding the high quality aluminum and glass remote. There’s a little chill when you first touch it.I love that there’s an app switcher and you can close background apps and see which background app are closed. Most TVs and streaming devices don’t have that. You just have to spam the back button and hope it closes.The interface is so smooth. I like the big app icons and the animations for opening and closing them. These apps change the way I watch TV. I don’t use my TV app. Instead I downloaded all the channel apps and open and close them instead. It’s fun opening the big app icons and seeing the bright app colors come to life. Then it’s fun swiping the remote and closing the current app from the background and choosing another channel/app to open.Apple Music is amazing. I’m watching music videos again like it’s 1994. Forever I was deprived of a music video channel. Now I can get introduced to all the latest music artists commercial free. If I wanna learn the lyrics I can just load up the song and watch the lyrics scroll by.I bought this thing way late into the generation but I like it so much I might buy the next one depending on the changes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2021","Amazonista",3
"Best impulse buy ever...","I was on the fence about getting one of these for years. I figured it wasn't necessary since I own both a smart TV and a PS4. I am singing a different tune now that I own one.First off, for such a small box, this thing is FAST. Whereas my TV and PS4 take a good ten to fifteen seconds to buffer and begin streaming, this thing is almost instantaneous in playing my content.Second, the picture quality is astounding. I don't own a 4K TV yet and even on my 2014 1080p TV, the image quality is more than worth the $180 price tag. I can only imagine what it will look like when I finally get a new TV. Test watching the three hour director's cut of Midsommar, I noticed that the colors popped even more than my Blu-Ray copy of it and the dark scenes were even more clearer and defined.Finally, the variety in apps. I primarily bought this cause I wanted to be able to stream Shudder and Criterion Channel on my TV since they weren't available on the PS4 (Also, watching Criterion content on my phone is a cinephile sin), I was not prepared for some of the options that are offered on here. You can order Grubhub using your TV. You read that right, Grubhub. As if I needed to get even more fat and lazy enough as it is. First world problems.All in all, this was an impulse buy for me that more than delivered on it's promise. I never thought of owning one before and now that I do, I don't know how I ever lived without it. I don't even bother using the apps on my TV anymore since the convenience of this box renders it unnecessary.

"Best video streaming for Dolby Vision Atmos","First, I am an Android phone user, but the Apple TV is a well built unit and supports Netflix, Amazon Prime, Youtube, AppleTV and more even if you don't have an iphone. However, you will need an Apple/iTunes account to download the mostly free Apps like Youtube etc. The nice thing is that the Apple TV 4K provides both 4K video resolution and supports Dolby Vision, Vision+ and Atmos sound for the major streaming systems (more movies are becoming available but so far have not seen any on Youtube). I have a Samsung 75"" QLED TV with a great picture but way too much sound latency when attaching to soundbars (even their own) so I bought a Yamaha RX A780 receiver which suports eARC and Dolby Vision/Vision+ and then found that eARC only supports Atmos sound with Vision+ only. This required connecting my 4K Bluray player, the Apple TV 4K and so on to the Yamaha HDMI input ports to eliminate latency and allow for Atmos. Since most movies only support Vision (not Vision+), I get Atmos when available through the Yamaha direct. The Apple TV 4K had the best options to play 4K with Atmos and a great user interface and remote but a bit pricey compared to the equivalent Firestick and Roku options.Take Aways:1. eARC mostly fixes latency but only supports Atmos through Dolby Vision+ but most movies are Dolby VisionSolution: Use Yamaha Receiver RX A780 which can produce Atmos sound from Dolby Vision2. You cannot get Netflix 4K videos to provide Atmos on most streaming devices but AppleTV 4K canSolution: Plug AppleTV 4K HDMI into the Yamaha Rcvr, not on the TV set since even eARC to an amplifier will not pass Dolby Vision (only Dolby Vision+)3. You cannot get most 4k Bluray players to produce the required Dolby Vision+ (very limited movies) and Dolby Vision movies connected directly to your TV set again will not pass through the eARC to an amplifier.Solution: Plug 4K Bluray player HDMI into the Yamaha Rcvr (or equiv)Last, I love the simple but powerful tiny remote that came with the AppleTV and it somehow sends the correct codes to my TV and other HDMI devices making it much more simplified.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2020","XMorth",3
"Yeah!","Apple is a mixed bag. Their products are pretty much ALWAYS more expensive than the competition. (Have to keep up appearances as a ""premium"" brand and have to keep growing profits for shareholders). Sometimes their stuff is legitimately better than everyone else's.....sometimes maybe not and you're just paying for the logo.In this case.........they are the best. I have a Roku Ultra. It's pretty bad for live streaming like Youtube TV. Sometimes it buffers or delivers stunning 480p picture quality, sometimes it's fine. Never a problem with this thing.Also the picture and audio quality really is better.Also the interface is better. No unwanted apps all over you home screen.The remote...................is not your father's remote. But I've come to like the track pad. It's a little flimsy but Apple is more obsessed with being thin and light than an 18 year old Miss Universe contestant so you just live with it.If you have reached a 4-K in the road (see what I did there?

"Best 4K available","I have a 77-inch LG OLED 4K TV. Streaming Dolby vision and 4K HDR looked pretty good on the LG native Netflix and Amazon apps - until I hooked up the Apple TV (with some issues noted below) - and looked at the Dolby Vision and 4K content using the same apps on the Apple TV. Folks, I don't know how they did it, but the Apple TV makes the 4K streaming content look as good as uncompressed Blu-Ray 4K disks. A major improvement, and this alone made the purchase worth every cent. It also supports Dolby Atmos, which I have installed in my home using a Yamaha RXA-3060 receiver and ceiling mount speakers. The only negative was the inability for the Apple TV to support Dolby Vision when passed through the Yamaha receiver. I had to (finally) resort to directly hooking the Apple TV to the HDMI 3 input on the LG TV and port the sound out to the receiver using an optical cable. There's no reason that Apple or Yamaha can give me why this is the case - the Yamaha supports Dolby Vision and Atmos from my Bluray player using the exact same HDMI cables. But the Apple TV - nope. I had to figure this out for myself because Apple support was useless. Their solution? By a particular HDMI cable made by Belkin for the Apple TV. Which I did, and which didn't solve the problem. So after some tinkering and talking to my local installer for the LG and Yamaha, we tried the optical output and - Viola - Dolby Vision and Atmos worked. And boy, do they work. Interestingly, HD streamed via the Apple TV looks very, very close to 4K. I downloaded HBO Go to the Apple TV and now watch my HBO programs, which are only broadcast in HD via DirectTV, on the Apple TV and enjoy near 4K that way. Wow.

I was really dreading typing in all of those user names and passwords, but I had it setup in less than 10 minutes with all passwords from HBO NOW, Netflix, etc. You can use Siri to input email and passwords. A huge time and sanity saver. You have to download the apps like other Apple devices, but that was fine and easy. I couldn't get the hang of the new remote, but I have a Logitech master remote, so it wasn't a big deal. I just need the Apple remote for Siri.No more buffering and the resolution was much better.

"Better than Android TV","I migrated to the Apple TV 4k from the Android Shield TV because it had the processing power necessary to decode my lossless mkvs, and the Infuse app is the only app out there that I know of that will read the full metadata encoded into the mkvs from the MetaX tagger.I have to say, I am beyond impressed with the Apple TV. Here's what I like about it:- The remote: The touchpad controller allows for really fast navigation through the UI, whereas the Shield TV controller requires a ton of presses- Keyboard input: On the Android TV, if you have long passwords, you will have to connect a keyboard unless you want to painstakingly navigate the on-screen keyboard and input each character via the remote. On the Apple TV, it will allow my iPhone to do password input and send it to the device, allowing me to use 1Password for filling in.- Apps: The quality of the same apps on Apple TV vs Android TV is just better. Ever try running Crunchyroll on Android TV? Yea, it doesn't work most of the time because the app thinks there's no internet and dies. Not only does Crunchyroll on Apple TV has no problems launching, but the UI is just *better*. It's a completely revamped UI compared to Android TV and works very well.- I completely recommend spending the $50 on the Infuse app on Apple TV if you have non-streaming high-quality video content. My mkvs play seamlessly and everything is properly categorized after telling Infuse to use the mkv metadata instead of fetching for metadata. I have NOT been able to find any kind of app on Android TV (VLC, Archos, etc) that can do this. The Infuse UI is just a joy to use.- Configuring audio and video support: With Android TV, you'll have go to in the weeds to configure specific settings for your display, speaker configuration, etc. Apple TV can do an analysis of your HDMI connection and determine what your system supports. Compared to Android TV, Apple TV required significantly less configuration to get it working with my home theater setup- Siri vs Google Assistant: While Google assistant is superior to Siri in many ways, GA only works on my Shield TV when I use the Shield game controller, which is just bulky as hell. I also have a Google Home Mini, but for whatever reason, 1/3 of the time, it only works with certain actions on Shield TV. There's no probs interacting with Siri directly on Apple TV.- It. Just.

"Great device - short life span.","Really excellent device even if the road to receiving the shipment was rocky. Really clear picture compared to my 3rd gen apple tv and there are a lot of new features that enhance the watching experience.

I bought this with the intent to upgrade to 4k hdtv at some point but it looks terrific with my 1080i tv.It does not have any digital audio output so it took some futzing to get the sound right with the tv and sound bar but I understand this is not an issue with newer TVs.

"At first didn't like it but over time have grown to love it.","We had an older HDR 10 TV which the Apple TV did not work at all with since it up converted everything to Dolby Vision and the TV did not like that signal. So we reluctantly upgraded our TV to a Dolby Vision model and now every device is happy and works perfectly. The Apple TV is so easy to use and the interface is clean and pretty. It is compatible with Netflix Atmos sound and works great. It comes with a crappy remote but luckily it has a built in IR sensor so you can use any universal remote you want with it and they even went a step above the rest and have a learning feature in the settings so you can teach it your other remote you want to use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2019","Scott",4
"I jumped into the world of OTT streaming back on ...","I jumped into the world of OTT streaming back on March 2017 with PS Vue and the Apple TV 4K is by far the fastest streaming device I've owned. The ATV 4K processor is what makes the difference and believe me, there is a huge difference. I won't mention the other two streaming devices I used before purchasing the ATV 4K on this post unless someone asks me. If you stream PS Vue, the ATV 4K will make all the difference in the world. No more having to clear cache and reboot the streaming device daily. The intermittent freezing and buffering issues have totally stopped. My internet speed (AT&T broadband) is around 53 Mbps and I've hard-wired the ATV 4K.

The Apple TV runs flawlessly on WiFi located from another room about 50ft away, through one wall. The signal dropped maybe twice in the months I’ve had the device and that resulted in pixelation that lasted maybe 5-10 seconds then snapped back to HD 4K. Mandalorian’s Baby Yoda looks adorable. The 4K wallpaper screensaver is very cool, nice addition, drone sweeps of cityscapes and atmospheres had me staring for a few minutes at all the details. I’ve had roku and this is more expensive but I think worth the polish and functionality. I haven’t even tried the games. It’s nice to have all our iTunes movies and shows a click away.

"The Apple TV is especially useful if you live in a remote location. The main improvement in picture Quality comes from the HDR","Since I have no local TV reception, no local cable company, do not pay for satellite TV, and i’m 45 minutes away from any place that rents movies, the Apple TV is my main source for movies To rent or buy. I would strongly recommend that if you wish to use the AppleTV extensively that you have the ISP that provides unlimited downloads, Especially with the 4K HDR. If you’re not into games There is no need to purchase the 64 GB version. The only negative that I can see right now is that despite the fact that this is supposed to be a 4K HDR system the YouTube app on this Apple TV will not currently play 4K HDR. The 4K HDR is only available for some movies at this time. Please note that not all 4K HDR movies are made with the same level of quality or Are converted from 1080 P versions. Which sort of defeats the purpose of this unit. But generally I would say that for the native4K HDR movies that the HDR alone it’s worth the Expense.The 4K resolution only really poses an noticeable improvement if you have a very large television. But the HDR or high dynamic range alone with HDR TV set produces exceptional black level and color rendition And the picture improvement is very noticeable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2018","Russell",12

"Cannot mirror iPhone to TV through Apple TV with purchased and downloaded movies","Well let me start by saying that I have a slow Gen3 cellular internet unlimited data connection to the internet for about half of the month. About 600k bytes/second for half of the month.The Apple TV, like a smart TV, or a smart Blu-Ray player, has the ability to install APPs and then stream the APP content to your non-smart (or even smart) TV via an HDMI cable.Let’s talk about Amazon Prime. And I hope I don’t confuse you...1) With the Amazon Prime APP on my Sony Smart TV, or on either of my smart Blu-Ray players, I open the Amazon APP and select a movie to play. The movie streams through my WiFi connection from my cellular modem just fine. If I am on Gen3 speeds (last half of the month approximately) the quality of the movie is more like SD rather than HD, but it successfully plays without interruption, stalling, or pixilation.2) Apple TV: When I connect the Apple TV device and use the Amazon Prime APP on the Apple TV this does not work with the slower Gen3, 600k per second connection. The picture stalls while the voice usually continues. I suspect that the Apple TV has no ability to step-down, step-back to a lower resolution to allow the stream to play uninterrupted. I purchased the $200 64GB version of the Apple TV late December 2017 early January 2018. Apparently this high end Apple TV also lacks the ability to buffer ahead, or pre-download enough content into its HUGE (and expensive) 64 GBytes of RAM to play properly. Very disappointed with that restriction.3) Pre-purchased and downloaded content: OK, so since I also have purchased half a dozen movies from Amazon Prime, have downloaded them directly onto my iPhone 8 Plus and watch them off line on my iPhone 8 Plus (big screen) I figured, well at least I could “SCREEN MIRROR” my Apple iPhone 8 Plus to the Apple TV and just watch a purchased movie (Guardians Of The Galaxy) on a big screen TV, through the Apple TV mirroring function, for the movies downloaded and “living” in my iPhone already. NOT! Evidently, this is a no-no (maybe because of some DRM rules?). Apple TV forbids downloaded movies, on my iPhone, from being allowed to play on Apple TV.4) Worse... when I use Apple TV’s APP and then go to my Amazon Prime library and try to play, with Apple TV’s Amazon Prime APP, movies that I have purchased I am told that I am not allowed to do that either!5) Even worse... OK, so I get out of the MY LIBRARY area of Amazon Prime, still on the Apple TV’s Amazon Prime APP and just go to the standard Amazon library of thousands of movies. I then select again GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY and figure that I may have to pay to rent it to see it with Apple TV, but then again, I am again forbidden from even streaming the Amazon library’s version of the movie even if I am will to buy it or rent it againBottom line: Once I purchase a movie from Amazon Prime there is no way at all to view it through Apple TV onto my TV. Whether through playing on my iPhone and screen mirroring it to the Apple TV, or accessing through the Apple TV’s APP my library on Amazon Prime, or ignoring my library on Amazon Prime and attempting to just re-purchase through the Apple TV and stream directly.I am disappointed that the Apple TV does not allow you to mirror your screen to a TV for content in my iPhone that is legally purchased.I am disappointed that the Apple TV does not step-down the resolution on slower speed internet connections, to allow a movie to stream, but instead just locks up the picture while the sound continues on.My 5 year old smart Sony TV and both of my 8 year old Panasonic Blu-Ray players all have APPs that step down the resolution to SD, instead of HD, when the internet connection slows down and allows the movie to keep streaming uninterrupted without pixilation.Apple TV does not do this. The video just “locks up” while the audio usually continues ahead without any video.I will be returning this, if I can, tomorrow.Bill Cooke","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2019","CapinCooke",21

"Don't waste your money","I'm heavily invested in the Apple Ecosystem, and when it came time buy a new streaming device I choose Apple TV 4K rather than another Roku. Pro Tip, get the Roku.Good features:FastLots of appsScreen casting is stupid easyProblems:It doesn't have all the apps you wantYou can't actually game on itThe Remote is hot garbageIt's fundamentally designed to be used by a single person. The last straw was when I tried to open a podcast on my phone as I was leaving the house, having put the Apple TV to sleep, and the Apple TV turned on, switched to my profile and started trying to play the podcast there instead. I had to turn off wi-fi on my phone to stop the hijacking.It's got too many problems, to be that expensive.

"Made a Move ....Bye to Amazon Fire TV....and others","I started buying Amazon Kindles, Fires, Fire TVs years ago but it appears quality has slipped. I went from being able to have a device for 3-4 years without upgrading unless I really wanted to, to now averaging 12-18 months before something starts to freeze up or present with problems that could not be resolved. Even when Amazon sent a free replacement, problems persisted and I suspected they just sent another “new” (used) unit or component. Don’t get me started on the number of Fire remotes I went through). I tried to hold out with Fire TV, but could no longer do so. When my second Fire TV component (Fire TV Stick 4K) started having issues, I was done. It lasted 7 months before the familiar glitchiness started and “mandatory new apps” filling what remained of my 8GB of space was the last straw. Why the heck can’t I delete apps I have no interest in. I decided I was not going to bother with another Fire TV device anymore just to increase space or get the latest and greatest to have it possibly die in 1-2 years.I was already in the Apple ecosystem with an IPhone, IPad, and MacBook (when my 6 year old Windows PC died last year), so getting the Apple TV was a no brainer — what a relief. Set up was a breeze. Interface is simple, cleaner, and uncluttered with stuff I don’t want or need to view. All my apps were easily found/installed. I’m not scrolling for miles to get to what I want to view or explore. All my Bluetooth components (sound bar, headphones, etc work like magic). I was cautious about reviews concerning the remote, but there’s no issue. After a day or so of familiarity, the remote is easy to use.People may grumble about the price point on Apple TV but I calculated what I spent on Amazon products/replacement for TV streaming and guess what...yeah....I’ll stick with Apple going forward. I’d rather upgrade when I want to or when something becomes obsolete due to tech advances; not be nickeled and dimed by poorly made Amazon devices.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2020","ALA",38

"Like most things Apple... nicely designed with a TERRIBLE remote.","The interface of the Apple TV is bettter than most any I've seen. It's responsive, nicely laid out and loaded with potential from the App Store.However, like most things Apple... they have one (or two) glaring flaws. For the Apple TV it's the remote. It's TERRIBLE and very poorly thought out. It's tiny and gets lost easily. It also is way too finicky. Sometimes it swipes fine... others not at all. You'll end up pausing things when you didn't want to and kicking yourself out of the app you're watching without even noticing. It's terrible. Use your phone if you have an iPhone otherwise you'll be very frustrated... A LOT.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2020","Cory Michel",39

"What not to do...but DO immediately manually look for updates.","If you're used to the old Apple TV, take it slow setting this up. It's very different both in the use of the remote as well as the layout of the graphics. Took me FOREVER to find the the top of the menu. But it works great. Beautiful image if a somewhat messy layout. Trying to find how to turn on subtitles, for instance, was extremely frustrating. I did. And in struggling through it found out I the first image opened way down the tree, and getting back to the top where ""settings"" is located was a challenge. As well, you'll be tempted to sign up to Apple TV+. It's a good deal, but it made things much more complicated for learning how to work through the menus. The touch feature on the remote is nice, but you have to press harder than you'd think to make the selection, and for some reason my fingers didn't always activate the touch feature of the screen. But the wide choice of apps and many (many) other features is nice. It's no longer just a tool for bringing your iTunes to the screen. It's a genuine decoder for all of your cable choices. I'm not sure I needed that since I'm a dedicated TiVo user, but that will be a choice I have to make down the road. Be sure and have your HD HDMI 2.0 cable ready before your Apple TV device arrives. Otherwise, you'll be frustrated that you can't hook it up. A normal HDMI cord won't cut it.After almost a week of frustraing freeze ups, rendering watching anything impossible, I was perusing the set-up screen wondering if it was me and not the device making me hugely disappointed in this product. ""Updates"" had been checked as automatic, so I felt secure the problem wasn't that. Nevertheless, I clicked ""check for updates"" anyway. But I was still getting, ""check your internet connection"" messages and freeze ups. I wondered if the location of the box might be an issue, so I moved it to a perch away from other devices. Suddenly, a message ""Downloading updates"" appeared. It was a BIG update. Once that was done (about 15 long, long minutes), B-I-N-G-O! The damned thing worked perfectly. Beautifully! Now whether it was the location of the device or the fact I shouldn't have relied on ""Update Automatically"" to catch this, I don't know. But do...DO immediately check for updates.The issue of the remote is still a mystery on it's use. After 10 tens, I still can't confidently locate any content. It's hit-or-miss and the thumb pad just plain sucks. But the screen display is beautiful in quality, and things--once I find them--play reliably.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2020","M. Fargo",39

"Remote is a disaster","First, let me say that we are mostly an IOS household and used the apple tv 3rd gen for many years until it quit working. So I bought the apple tv 4K to replace our old one, thinking it would also be a pleasure to use. Boy was I in for a shock. First the pro: the processor is better, but this was expected, the screen savers are wonderful, and it was easy to set up. The con: the display of icons is much poorer than the old display, the remote is a complete disaster! Has Apple ever heard of the phrase ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"". The 3rd gen remote was elegant in its simplicity. Could they not have built upon its design and added more buttons to allow for increased functions? I should not have to go to the internet in order to use remote! It should be intuitive. Second, the controls are simply hard to use and often result in wrong actions. I finally have resorted to using the old remote for many functions and use the new one to turn everything on or off. I do not understand why so many companies think progress has to mean and increase in difficulty. Finally, for the money spent, I expected much more from Apple and they failed me miserably! UPDATE: After using for several more weeks, I have given up on the remote and use it only for turning it on and off. I use my 3rd gen remote for navigating and operating the apple 4k. In the past, I have always just bought Apple products because they were simply better. In the future, I will be looking at its competitors much more before buying and will not buy from Apple again without a thorough investigation.Update: Feb. 2020.Well the box is already giving us problems! Using it for Netflix, causes it to quickly slow down when browsing, to the point of being unusable. The problem only occurs with Netflix. Seems suspicious to me and whenever I reboot it goes to their icon. We use a Roku in another room and it works flawlessly. Since it is about half the price of an apple tv, guess what we will be buying next time. Just be warned if you are looking for a streaming device!Update: Feb 23 2020.I am finally fed up with having to reboot in order to use Netflix. Even after rebooting, the browser only works for a few minutes and then slows so much that it becomes unusable. I think I should be able to expect a device that costs $150 to work! This product , with its disastrous remote, does not! It seems unique to Netflix and not other channels. This seems very suspicious to me. Anyway, today, I ordered a Roku. I probably will never buy another apple streaming device again!","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2019","Gdadgd",41

Literally 1 year and one week from purchase, your product will cease to function. Returning it to the store will only result in the sales people urging you to replace it at full cost (Buy a new one, just to have it fail again a year later).I Did not pay $200 to RENT an AppleTV 4K, I bought it! I expect a unit with no moving parts, hooked to a UPS and running on a solid UPS protected Network, to function a hell of a lot longer than 1 year!I am working with my local BBB and they confirmed that there are at least 30 others in the metro area with the exact same story, (1 year +1 week and poof!).","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2019","Kirc Breden",44

"Matching Dynamic Range and Frame Rate","I've had Apple TVs since 2017. They are the best streamer I have experienced so far. I already have my order in for Apple TV 4K 2nd Generation (2021 model). I have so much hope in that new one. . . !Nevertheless, I feel compelled to write this review when thousands and thousands have already reviewed this device due to a personal and profound revelation I realized when I least expected it. I have a 2020 Marantz SR6015 AVR and a 2020 LG OLED 65CX HDTV. Both these devices have advanced high audio resolution, and high picture definition, and high dynamic range capabilities. The new Apple TV in 2021 will (finally) be commensurate with the abilities of those 2020 devices.Since 2017, I have always set my Apple TVs to the highest dynamic range available as a default. Except the Dolby Vision setting, which was too “sepia toned” and inappropriate for anything that wasn’t filmed in Dolby Vision. To me, this mindset provided the best HDR viewing experience that I was desiring and paying for. Even when colors would sometimes be “out-of-this-world” super saturated, I thought this was the way it should be. Moreover, there is a lot of source content produced in the 1920s and since then that Dolby Vision would make look totally wrong.OLD MINDSET:* 4K HDR 60Hz* Match Dynamic Range* Match Frame RateIn time, after a lot of reading and analyzing my own system, I decided to try 4K SDR 60Hz, when I realized that most movies were filmed in 24fps, but you never know what you’re getting, so one-size does not fit all. By applying HDR or 60Hz to everything, Apple TV was making everything super saturated and interfering in the upscale function of the LG OLED, if the source wasn’t being passed through as 4K and needed upscaling to 4K. Years past, filmmakers didn’t have Dolby Vision or HDR10+, but they knew how to make a picture beautiful with 35mm or 70mm, when they wanted to. Applying the automatic 4K HDR 60Hz filters as a default is not really making things better. I found that applying 4K SDR 60Hz (as default) without applying “artificial” filters to everything, whether classic films or contemporary, the Apple software and LG software worked more cooperatively to render “what the director intended” in just about everything I’ve seen since my new mindset. I intend to continue this mindset to the 2021 Apple TV 4K as well. I believe there will be faster processing and the addition of the Apple Neural Engine to output the “best” entertainment. Dolby Vision, HDR10+, high resolution audio—all these—are part of the dynamic range concept in current films and video. It’s better to match dynamic range than to automatically apply a fixed dynamic range.NEW MINDSET:* 4K SDR 60Hz* Match Dynamic Range* Match Frame RateWhatever system you have for your audio/video processing, you have to find the best mechanical, electrical, and acoustical synergy, such that not any one component voids the best work of the other.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2021","RBJ",50

"If you're in the Apple Ecosystem, you should already have this...","Overall, this a great product, especially if you're already in the Apple ecosystem. This device really extends your capabilities from your existing products like your Mac, iPhone, iPad, not to mention your Apple related services. For instance, from my computer I can stream music from my Mac to all my AppleTV's in the house at a single location. I have 3 of these throughout the house hooked to sound systems, It's the little things like that, that makes you really appreciate the ecosystem.When it comes to its primary purpose to play your multimedia, it does it well, or at least just as good as everyone else. Almost every available service is available including Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Disney, and of course AppleTV+. It will even play games, but I don't use it for that.The biggest drawback is the Apple-Tax. For this model, you're basically paying 3x's as much as the competition. If you're already in the Apple ecosystem, its worth it and I would highly recommend. If you're not, you'll never be able to utilize all the features it's capable of. I would go advise to go with another brand and save your money. .","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2020","Arnell",50

"Worst Apple device I’ve ever purchased","Purchased to replace a third gen Apple TV which was our primary streaming device, simple to use and highly reliable. The new one is nearly useless for anything other than Apple content.- the device only comes configured with Apple TV.+. You must download an app to view any other content- the Hulu app flat out doesn’t work. Has only successfully connected once. Just spins and won’t connect. Have to keep a roku on the tv just to access that service- remote is a disaster. If you just want to pause a show and touch it wrong it forwards to another point in the program. I’ve given it 3 weeks and still have to be extremely careful even touching it while content is playing. I keep the old 3g one nearby because it fortunately works with the unit and you can actually use it.- software user interface, which was excellent in the 3g, is a frustrating mess. Shocking for an Apple product. Very difficult to navigate and generally a frustrating waste of time- picture is fine. There has to be a better way to get a decent 4K picture.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2020","T Arthur",51

"Great for Apple TV+. For everything else? Meh.","I was pleased with the way it could connect to my apple account so easily. But every other app - netflix, prime, hulu, etc - all required manual setup. Since this is the second apple TV unit in our home and they're on the same account, this was a little disappointing.Storage: My previous (non-4k) apple TV, is a 64gb. Unless you're downloading video to it, there's no need to get anything but the lowest capacity version.Remote: The remote that comes with the new 4k units is a step up, it has a little tactile circle around the menu button. Other than that, it is still oddly confusing. A menu button and a button with a picture of a TV? In many apps, they seem to be essentially the same.The touchpad/button at the top is sometimes wonderful (in some apps, a flick of the finger moves you to where you want to be) and annoying (in others, it does... things. Not always sure what). I wish there was an option to require some pressure before the touchpad did anything.I am told that the unit has excellent wifi, but I use a hardwired ethernet connection. There is no link or activity indicator for the network jack, which does avoid annoying flashing lights next to a TV, but also makes it a whole lot of slide-and-click to figure out if it is connected, and no way of verifying that it's getting the expected (10/100/1000) connection. If Apple wants to make network connections cool, how about making the unit PoE-ready, to get rid of the power cable?And speaking of cables, there is no HDMI cable with the unit. Happily, we have spares, but if we weren't a household of IT people, I would have been annoyed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2021","Stretch",52

"Box ok, Remote a Frustrating Failure","The box works fine and is worth 4 stars, but the black stick remote is stupid and deserves a 1. I've never met anyone who likes it, the top ""trackpad"" area make you want to throw it at a wall too often. It doesn't respond to your finger uniformly, overshoots icons, and often you press it to find you missed the one you wanted. 4 circle buttons with a center OK (like literally EVERY other remote in existence) would work perfectly in light or dark and give positive feedback instead of the absurd scratching this way and that, being so careful not to press too hard and choose, wondering why it's not moving the cursor on the screen. The engineers at Apple totally blew this one. The phone app works better and it's still not as good as a simple 5 button circle. You can use the talk function to try to go around, but like much of Apples evolving interfaces Siri gets dumber each year instead of smarter. The point with Apple was always to design simple, effective, smart. Sell the box with a discount and loose the useless remote. Too sexy and not sensible. I finally in frustration threw mine at my $2k tv screen and broke it. Took a hammer to the stupid stick and finally felt better. Wish Steve was still around, Apple is loosing it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2020","Sonoma Dan",53

"Worst Apple Product I've Ever Purchased","I am a completely happy cord cutter and I have used this apple tv device for just over a year now on my primary watching TV. During that time, I have also used Roku and Amazon Fire TV devices on other TVs. Through that experience and comparison to other devices, I have come to this conclusion: APPLE TV IS THE WORST PRODUCT APPLE HAS EVER PRODUCED, HANDS DOWN. And I say that as an AVID Apple user. I am typing this review on a Macbook Pro, sitting next to my apple iPhone, having owned multiple generations of both. There are probably more apple products in my home than any other brand. Long way of saying I generally like apple products, even if they cost more, at a minimum for their reliability but also for their ingenuity.My complaints about Apple TV are many, and the types of problems will ring familiar to regular apple users. First, let's start with the remote control. Apple just HAD to incorporate a touch pad, because that's what apple does -- less buttons, more touch stuff. Well that is generally unhelpful for many things you use a remote for: scrolling channel guides is an adventure; trying to navigate DVR content with a touch pad is an unmitigated disaster; and any time you move or touch the remote it pauses the tv or engages some other function. The size of the remote is tiny too, much like an Amazon Fire remote, but at least the Amazon Fire has buttons. Roku is old school in size and hand fit, and is easily the best among these three. Tiny remotes are a solution in search of a problem. Oh, and of course the Apple TV remote has to be charged using an apple charging wire. Batteries would be too old school and just work more easily I guess.My biggest gripe about the Apple TV is its reliability and functionality in general. I would estimate that at least half the time when I turn my TV on, the Apple TV device is on (light on front showing) but the TV can't find it. So I have to go unplug the Apple TV device and replug it to restart it. This usually solves the problem. Then many times, I'll get a recurring message that says ""no internet connection."" Usually the picture is still playing, but sometimes the message will keep appearing and the playback will pause. I know I have a good connection because initially to try to overcome this problem, I HARD WIRED the Apple TV device into my router. I have an ethernet cable connection so this message is absurd, especially when I'm running a number of other internet devices on WIFI seamlessly. The worst thing about this problem is that when you google it, you quickly find a common Apple glitch scenario: many people have this same problem and there is no solution. Other playback problems include intermittent quality of picture like I'm experiencing currently as I type this, and sometimes the video will freeze while the audio continues, and then the video will -- in fast forward style catch up.If you think these problems are just standard streamer glitches, the whole reason I'm writing this review is to assure potential buyers this is not the case. Using several other streaming devices, I have NEVER experienced the same consistent problems as I have with this garbage Apple TV device. I am at the point that I am going to throw this piece of crap out and buy a Roku or Amazon Fire device because I cannot stand the frustration of this awful, unreliable paperweight. Everything about the experience of Apple TV has felt to me like Apple decided they wanted in on the streaming TV device market, produced a device the way they make other Apple devices and with almost no regard to what works and is reliably functional, and turned out a glitchy, unreliable but sleekly designed Apple thing that they would sell for more than anyone else's device.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ROTTEN APPLE EVEN IF YOU ARE AN AVID APPLE LOVER. YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED.Edited to add: I swapped out this POS Apple TV with a Roku device I had on another tv that I use significantly less. The Roku device is a little slower in changing channels and the home menu is less sleek I guess, both things Apple does better. But in terms of streaming and basic functionality, I haven't had a single problem since switching to the Roku I already owned. I'm not an advocate or paid by any of these device people, just sharing my own personal experience, and I am incredibly disappointed in the Apple TV that I paid a premium for. And I'm not an Apple hater, I'm the opposite, probably an over-consumer of Apple stuff. In the meantime, I've ordered a replacement CAT-7 wire just to take all other variables out of the equation for a reasonable ~$15, but it seems pretty clear to me the Apple device is the weak link that is letting me down.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2020","VNovaCat",53

"Streaming 4K TV and movies? Apple TV 4K is the device for you!","I bought the Apple TV 4K because I was tired of the lack of Dolby Vision option from Roku and Nvidia Shield TV. My 2016 LG 4K TVs can't output Dolby Atmos via HDMI via ARC. With the added bonus of a year of Apple TV+ included and curiosity about Apple Arcade, I decided to let an Apple product into the house for the first time since 1999.First, it's nice to see the interface and system are just as simple to use as Roku or Shield TV. I was able to setup and configure everything to my liking fairly quickly.Apple TV 4K has most every app I use, which includes Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Vudu, Crunchyroll, and others. To my surprise, just days later, Amazon Music was added. I had heard Apple upgraded some iTunes movies to 4K, and since my first digital redemptions years ago were all iTunes, it's cool to see some of those movies are available in 4K with HDR. Dolby Vision has some weird issues with the Apple TV+ previews, but I'm hoping that gets sorted out. Amazon Music app doesn't stream the new hifi quality (HD and Ultra HD? lol) service which makes little sense.I have yet to spend much time with Apple Arcade, but it has unique titles that are of interest.Overall, Apple TV 4K is the streaming device I wanted. 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and the streaming services I use all in one place. Adding in the year of TV+ that comes with recently buying the device, I feel like it it was a good deal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2019","Zapix",54

Replace the touch pad with a traditional arrow pad and the remote would be just fine.

"Beautiful screen color, horrible voice to text and remote","I purchased this product 6 months ago. The product arrived in a timely manner and looked exactly as pictured.PROS:1. Picture quality is amazing2. Lots of apps to choose from3. The device and remote look very nice.CONS:1. The remote control is a pain to use. After 6 months I absolutely detested the remote.2. The voice to text was rarely correct. When it was correct I would hit submit/send and it would then re-analyze the voice to text and change it. It was incredibly frustrating.3. The device is expensive at $200.00 USD.After 6 months of frustration I decided to purchase Google TV. It has the same beautiful picture but the remote is much easier to use and the speech to text works almost perfectly. The actual Google TV (the physical device and remote) are not as pretty as the Apple one but they do a much better job. Google TV was 25% ($50.00) the cost of Apple TV.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2021","S. Scott",54

"Disappointing. Look elsewhere or stay with cable/satellite.","The Apple TV 4K 64 GB has been a disappointment. I bought two and am currently trying to get rid of them. The user experience is ruined by the below average interface (compared to those of either Dish, DirecTV or Xfinity) and the shambolic Siri remote. The mode of navigation between various contents is endless cumbersome scrolling. There are no numbers on the remote or other typical shortcuts. I use Fubo and Apple TV+ as my main content providers and in both cases navigating to the desired channel or show is clumsy. The remote has too few buttons and the touch pad is sensitive to the point where you cannot even touch it inadvertently without some adverse effect. The forward/backward skip interval is only 10 seconds instead of the typical 30 seconds and infuriatingly buggy.The Apple TV OS is mostly stable with occasional bugs, like the one described above and freezing unrelated to the internet speed (mine is wired gigabit).On a related topic, beware of 4K. It uses bandwidth at ~8 GB/hour, which means that the typical 1 TB/month limit imposed by your internet service provider will be reached in 128 hours of TV use alone. I had to limit both of my Apple TV 4Ks to 1080p in order to get by and let the TV do the upscaling to 4K with zero discernible viewing difference.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2020","SEK",55

"Great User Experience","I recently switched to this new AppleTV 4K after using an Amazon Fire 4K device, Google Chromecast, and an older generation AppleTV. This is the most expensive of all of those mentioned, but Apple really makes the user interface elegant and seamless. With my 4K UHD TV, I am able to access a full range of video and audio controls because of the Dolby Vision integration. Ironically, the TV I use has a built in FireTV interface, and I can do way more to control the video and sound via the AppleTV 4K than I can through the native software on the TV itself. Because of this, I get a lot more out of the TV in terms of quality, and since I have a whole bunch of other Apple devices already, the TV seamlessly integrates with the whole ecosystem. The apps rarely freeze or glitch, which happens constantly with any Amazon Fire device that I've had, and the UI controls are the same throughout, which is also not the case with other Streaming TV platforms I've used. The system is also very fast, which little lag time or hiccups, which was also a constant issue with my FireTV devices. Overall, I'm very impressed with the AppleTV 4K and it is the primary way I access streaming content now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2020","Forrest",56

"Good Replacement for an Amazon Fire TV","We got another TV for our living room and relegated our older TV to the den with the Amazon Fire TV we'd been using with it. When searching Amazon for a replacement unit, I found the flat, thin, square, functional box type unit we'd been using has been replaced with a ""cube"" that comes with numerous microphones so the user has not real expectation of privacy r/t Alexa. The older unit we had required the user to hold down the microphone-rebus button the remote control to activate Alexa. Better for privacy, requires actual intent to use. For that reason, I bought the Apple TV.The Apple TV set up seamlessly and easily using one of our Iphones and our Apple account. Siri voice activation can be turned off. User interface makes okay sense over against the Fire TV interface. Apps are easy to find and download. Streaming is about as hassle-free as our old Fire TV unit. No worries about finding the remote because our phones or Ipads have that functionality with the Apple TV. Still learning some of the devices settings, but overall a positive experience using this item.Oh. The remote - that's my only real gripe - touchscreen & click functionality takes some getting used to. Also, it's easy to invert the remote and think you're using the touchscreen when really, that's the palm of your hand activating random apps or settings on the screen. Easy to find the Menu button, though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2020","Christov",56

"Dolby Vision","So if you have a 4K OLED TV and you hate cable, this is the answer. Before you haters start calling me an apple fan boy I need to tell you that I was using OSMC (Kodi) running on a raspberry pi 3+ for my older 1080p TV. Since I upgraded my TV to 4K OLED I wanted to try out something more powerful. I ordered both Apple tv 4k and Nvidia shield (without the game controller) after my extensive research. In the end I returned the shield.What makes this Apple TV superior compared to the Nvidia shield? It comes down to dolby vision. If you recently moved from a regular LED TV to OLED TV then you could have noticed that OLED TV is not as bright as regular LED TV, this is normal for OLED TV and they are meant to be watched in a darker environment. When I watched the same 4K Netflix show on both Nvidia shield and apple TV, I noticed that apple TV will automatically enable Dolby vision which not only makes the picture much brighter but also gives you a more realistic representation of the colors in the show. Dolby vision is not supported by Nvidia shield. In order to take full advantage of Dolby vision you will need to connect Apple TV with a high speed HDMI cable.Siri is OK in my experience, I don't like to use it very often but when I have to search for something I could just speak which beats the hell out of trying to type on the screen one letter at a time. Yes, if you own an iPhone you could use that for typing as well but trust me, speaking is always faster. The search function is nice as it can search for shows and movies across the apps. Sometimes when I want to watch a movie and I'm not sure if it is on Netflix or Amazon or HBO I could just have Siri search for me.The remote is not comfortable to use as it is very small and flat, I guess it's not meant to be held in your palm but rather lay it flat in your Louis Vuitton tray and classically sliding your finger on top of it to control the TV. Well i won't know because I couldn't even find it anymore since it slipped into the crack between my sofa.Yeah just use the TV remote if you can. my LG TV remote can control pretty much everything on this apple TV.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2019","Highland Oasis",56

"Update Your Software!","Ok- I was ready to send this beast from hell back after about 3 hours of banging my head against the wall. I could not figure out how to watch Apple + shows and every set of official and non-official instructions said, just ""click on the Apple TV app and watch your shows."" HAHAHAHA!After a couple hours of successfully stringing together some very creative adult only phrases and dirty looks from the dog, I gave up and went to watch some YouTube videos and some guy made an off-hand comment when describing the interface- ""oh yeah here is where you update the software."" I'm pretty tech savvy and am embarrassed to say that didn't even occur to me. So I did. And voila' as the French say, it worked. Before updating it had the old Apple TV app on it. Once I updated the new one with the new familiar icon was there and I was ready to roll into some sweet Amazing Stories.So- I'm pretty happy now- it was easy to setup (with the exception of the previously mentioned buffoonery) and looks and sounds great. It was very easy to integrate with my Logitech Harmony remote. Downloading apps like Netflix and others was easy-you just have to sign in with your Apple ID.So-4 out of 5 stars because of the software update fiasco (I should have thought of it, but hey I can't take the blame for everything- we're in the middle of a deadly corona virus pandemic and I need to keep my self esteem up.)Bottom line- update the software!

"Great performance. Smooth interface.","I have one of these hooked up to an LG OLED55B7P and it's a great pairing. I'm currently running tvOS 12 beta, which enables Dolby Atmos support (in addition to Dolby Vision, which is already supported in the stock tvOS 11 version).Image and sound are excellent. Arguably that's largely a credit to the attached components, but Apple's box is capable of providing the content to match. The iTunes content is often a little ahead, but other content is not far behind (e.g., I also regularly use the Amazon Prime Video app on Apple's box and that work really well also).Where I find that the Apple TV experience really shines, however, is the grace and fluidity of the user interface. Somehow, alternatives I've tried (a) often stutter (performance problems), (b) have an unintuitive navigation system, and/or (c) are unattractive. I'm talking about the on-screen interface here, but also about the remote: The remote is easy to grip, the buttons are human-sized (so many remotes have these tiny buttons that require some focus to actually operate), and the touchpad (the upper area of the remote) makes navigation intuitive and very fluid. I own the previous-generation model of this too, whose remote was frequently criticized for being too symmetric. I didn't really find it a problem because if I gripped it upside down my thumb would fall on the volume button instead of the menu button, and the former has a different shape (it's oblong). However, Apple did respond to that criticism in two ways: visually (by adding a bright white ring around the menu button) and physically (by adding a raised edge to the menu button, giving it a very distinctive tactile feel). The remote may still not be perfect, but it's my favorite among all the many remotes in the house. Thanks to HDMI CEC (which allows Apple TV to wake/sleep the screen, and control volume), it's the only remote I need to operate our TV (we get all of our content through Apple TV; e.g., we don't have a cable subscription).Recent tvOS versions also enable AirPlay 2, which allows us to use the TV as an additional audio source in a whole-house audio solution. If you're invested in Apple's overall ecosystem, it's a nice little perk too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2018","David V.",57
"The Apple TV is fine but the ""touch"" remote control is horrible.","I upgraded from an earlier version. While I have no problems with the Apple TV, the remote is just terrible. It is a combination of buttons and touch. The touch part of the controls are extremely sensitive. It's very difficult to control the curser. And once I have the cursor where I want it, say to select a video, the act of pushing down to click on that selection is enough to change the location of the cursor so I end up opening something else. For the same reason using the search feature is a nightmare. And you can sometimes pause a video with just a touch on the remote, other times you must click. Half the time I pause a video only to have the cursor move and open more options when try to restart the video. My wife refuses to use the remote after trying it a few times. Makes me really wish for the older controls.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2021","danmonsterman",57
"Typical Apple design at the expense of some usability","Hardware and software seem quite reliable, they work flawlessly with no loss of signal or picture/sound quality. The problems come in, however, when using this twitchy remote. As is typical with many Apple products, in their attempt at making a bit of technology so streamlined (for looks) and ""intuitive"" for easy use, the end result is quirky with a few inherent usability flaws.The touch pad is ridiculously over-sensitive, inaccurate, and a sure-fire way to lose your place if you try and tap-back 10 seconds, or use the finger-slide method to scroll backwards in your video/show... Heck, it even kicks you right out of the video you were enjoying! ARGH!!! Sometimes, Tim Cook/Jonny Ives, fewer buttons doesn't equate to easier use. Four stars is generous, minus one for the lousy remote interface. Better yet, load the Apple TV App on to your phone, and use it that way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2020","average hubby",57

"One shiny apple!","We have a Samsung television and apple phones and computers. This has not made for an easy relationship! A few weeks ago we started having trouble with the Smart Hub on the TV which wouldn’t allow us to watch any of our streaming services. One of the solutions was to bypass the smart hub altogether and get the Apple TV. When it arrived, we had it installed and set up with our streaming services in less than 15 minutes. After the hours we spent trying to fix the smart hub, we were totally impressed by the product. The remote voice control is perfect and the sleek, responsive touch pad is why I love Apple. Samsung may continue to make integrating Apple products difficult, but this product restores my belief in why Apple is at the top of the game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2020","Michelle Bickers",58

"The worst remote I've ever used.","The new interface is attractive, but the remote is so lousy, I can't be sure if the interface is slow, or it's just the connectivity issues with the remote. I cannot stress enough just how horrible the remote is. They replaced a normal directional pad with this clunky touch sensitive pad that either doesn't work at all or lags and then clicks four steps beyond where you want it to go. And for some reason, the remote also disconnects and reconnects at random, making the user experience that much worse.And a side note, they added volume control to this remote...thumbs up, Apple....but they didn't give you a TV power button. So you still have to keep a second remote around.The picture quality is great, and I see zero issues with 4k streaming. But considering the remote issues, I still have a hard time imagining how this made it last quality control at Apple.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 29, 2020","Liquid Drummer",58

So, the Fire Cube and the fire tv devices froze often. Not so with this device. It is streaming Spectrum (easily), Prime, netflix, and youtube. I run it via my iphone, which is super easy - much better than remote that came with it. Hate that thing actually, and threw it in a drawer.

I have used a 4K ROKU and the LG’s own built in APPS to watch Netflix in 4K. Neither of those compares to the picture quality I am seeing now. Not by a long shot. When I 1st setup the Apple TV device it asked me if I wanted to use Dolby Video 4K at 60Hz. It did a little compatibly test and Boom it used that setting. Everything and I mean everything I play looks better. It’s comparable in quality to a movie played on my Oppo 4K Blu-Ray player. That alone I thought would be impossible due to the higher compression rate of streamed video. If you have a high end TV you absolutely must own this device.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2020","CyberTom",59

"Not a Reliable Streaming Platform","I have to say I wanted to love this product as I have loved all apple products, and when it came out of the box I did. The issues only started when I used it for what it was designed for - to stream content. The most important problem with the Apple TV is the fact that it does not reliably play streaming content and often goes into a death spiral “spin”. You know what I mean about that wheel of death. Even when it does not freeze and try to reload altogether, it frequently just stops producing audio or gets stuck on the video even though the audio keeps going. I have almost a gig of reliable download speed from Xfinity, so my bandwidth is not the problem. I was so frustrated tonight that I disconnected the thing - no easy feat because it is wired into the home theater and connect my Fire Cube from another room - bang, back in business and no issue whatsoever. So if it is not the network and another streaming platform has no issue, then it has to be the Apple TV. I thought I was just going to have to eat the cost and go buy another Fire TV, but I was super happy to find I could still return it. One other negative is the remote. It looks SOOOO beautiful, but whoever thought a fragile glass TV remote was a good idea lived in a china shop with no people. Remotes get dropped, they fall through cushions and end up on the floor. Less than 2 days after having it, there was a ship in the glass. On top of that, the remote does not respond to the touch pad swipes. You are swiping and swiping - it does not repond and then suddenly it does and you are five icons over from where you were trying to get only to repeat the whole cycle again. Yes the Fire TV and Roku (I have both in different rooms) are a bit slower with the mechanical button, but at least they respond when you push them. One upside I liked and which sold me to try it when I had such good experience with Fire TV was the year free Apple +. We watched a few things and the content was excellent, but if I want that I can just pay for it on the app I download on Fire TV and not have to deal with the frustration of the streaming freezing all the time.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2020","Deanna Legge",59
"The remote control is terrible and no directions were included.","I recently purchased my second Apple TV unit, 4K 64GB.I have always enjoyed Apple TV as overall as it has good.

"Will not work with Xfinity Stream app","Easy to set up but after several attempts it would not connect to my WiFi. Apple support had to guide me through a “hard reboot” and then it worked fine. Xfinity customers beware. I have two iPhones and an iPad that all have the Xfinity Stream app that allows us to watch whatever is live or recorded on my Xfinity dvr. I made the mistake of assuming that I would be able to do the same with Apple TV. WRONG. The Apple TV App Store is much different than the iPhone App Store. The Xfinity Stream app is not in the Apple TV App Store and another call to apple tech support told me that you cannot get Xfinity Stream for Apple TV. This was disappointing because it was the main reason I bought Apple TV. 5 stars to apple tech support.

"It Was Worth it to Me","This was my first and only Apple product purchase and so far it was worth every penny. I do not have a 4K TV yet, but I do have a huge iTunes library of TV and movies that I have purchased via iTunes for Windows over the years. It made more sense for me to purchase a streaming device that would allow me to access my iTunes library and Apple TV let's me do that.The packaging was just beautiful. Setup was intuitive and super easy. Unlike some, I just love the remote (once I figured out that you need to press down on the top of the remote to click on an item). The resolution on my OLED TV is just beautiful. The Apple TV runs super fast for me and has hundreds of free apps, podcasts and shows to watch. The settings menu is thorough and allows numerous privacy options. The aerial screensaver is spectacular.So why not 5 stars? Audio is why. It is shocking to me that in the 21st century audio options would be so limited (especially from Apple!). That being said, the 5.1 surround sound works great and sounds fine.Yes, I could have purchased a less expensive 4K streaming device that would have provided a few things Apple TV doesn't but I wouldn't have had access to my iTunes library. So, all in all I am pretty happy with Apple TV. Would gladly purchase again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2018","RDSWY4",60

"Coolest device since sliced bread.","Coolest device since sliced bread. Be sure to install tubi for FREE. You can watch movies and TV shows for FREE with NO subscription, and they have different movies than the Amazon-NETFLIX track.I don’t like how tiny and slippery the remote is. The mouse-clicker on the remote is also too sensitive. If you put it in your pocket while a video is playing, chances are you’ll click it unintentionally.I don’t like how you cannot skip ahead or reverse 10-seconds easily with the YouTube app like you can with every other video platform (Amazon app for tvOS, hulu, etc.). Perhaps that is a design flaw with the YouTube tvOS app.Not sure I am satisfied with the minimalist tvOS interface. It leaves me wanting more. It would be cool if I could use word processing apps with a Bluetooth keyboard on my Apple TV (via my TV), but it doesn’t seem to work that way.I like how I can connect my Bluetooth earbuds/earmuffs to my Apple TV and listen privately without bothering anyone else in the home.Sometimes Siri doesn’t understand me exactly, which is strange, considering that there is a microphone built into the remote in my hand. Also, this is not your normal Siri, but rather this is Siri’s retarded little sister who can only do specific commands as clearly stated: “FF 30sec,” “Play ‘Terminator’ on Amazon,” etc. If you ask tvOS Siri who is the President, she won’t know what you’re talking about.I like that I can put my Apple TV to sleep and my TV turns OFF (sometimes) and turns back on when I awaken my Apple TV (sometimes). I also like how I can teach my Apple TV remote to learn Vol. UP/DOWN for my sound bar, but it cannot turn ON/OFF my sound bar.I LOVE how I can use my iPhone/iPad as an Apple TV remote by swiping down my Control Pane. I also love how I can wirelessly mirror my iPhone/iPad and stream videos from my iPhone/iPad with my Apple TV.

"A little more costly than some other options but solid integration and AppleTV+ sweetens the deal","Bought this as an upgrade to replace a 4th generation lightly used AppleTV (2015 model), already connected to a 4K display. It was very easy to transition from 4th generation to 5th (4K) generation, as it kept the app layout intact. The upgrade took far less than 30 minutes. I enjoy the sharper images, but it really wasn't bad beforehand. It's just forward progress and product refinement.Update (8/2020): An additional refinement for customers using wired connections, one which I overlooked initially, is the move from 10/100 on the HD model to gigabit Ethernet on the 4K model. If your downstream path is responsive enough, 4k streams pop up nearly instantly.Content offerings have improved steadily since I first wrote this review back in 2017— making this an even more solid purchase today thanks to an expanded variety of content available including AppleTV+ and Amazon Music. I have added an additional 4K unit to fully replace my HD unit, which has now been relegated to my travel kit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2018","Tim Boda",61
"A swing! and a miss","OK, so it's a streaming box, and an expensive one. I expect it to have a good user interface, but it's remote is poorly thought out. I used it with the Youtube TV app, and that combination was awful, partially due to the Apple remote, and partially due to the Youtube App. The remote has a small trackpad on top, which functions worse than the trackpad on the 8 year old Samsung remote I have in another room, and I didn't think anyone could make a worse remote than Samsung. And you wanna turn the TV off? No on/off button, you have to hold down one button to bring up a menu, and then go to the trackpad and tap. Sheeesh. I also bought a $39 Tivo Stream 4K, and it's better. I'm going to try the nVidia Shield pro next, fingers crossed.

"Worst remote design ever","I live in a household of many Apple devices including a much used 2nd generation Apple TV. After the old one got zapped by a power surge, it was time for an up to date replacement. I guess my mistake was assuming Apple would have built on the simple and elegant interface and remote that they had got so right previously. Nope. They apparently hired some 12 year old interns for that part. The menus are a confusing jumbled mess made almost impossible to navigate by the worst remote design ever. Watching something and want to jump back 30 seconds to hear that last line of dialog again? No button for that. Just press rewind instead? No button for that. Instead you get a touch screen surface which if you get the gesture exactly right might rewind a bit. Or not. It could just dump you back to the main menu. In a sane world the team that designed this remote and every department head who signed off on it would now be unemployed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2020","TL",61

"Excellent System but still a little confusing for the non iOS","I have had the Apple TV 4k for a little over a week now and am very satisfied with it. A few comments based on reviews I read before I purchased:The Remote - Not as awful as everyone said. Yes, it's easy to select something or press the touchpad accidentally but I have had few issues overall. I don't think it's any worse than dropping my universal remote or hitting a wrong button on another remote. My only complaints about the Apple TV remote is that there is no mute button and it is quite small, so don't misplace it!UI - I'm not very familiar with the iOS environment. I have an iPhone but have only had it a couple of years so I'm still behind the function curve. Overall the system was mostly intuitive but I did make sure to familiarize myself with some online hints and tricks before it arrived so I knew how to navigate.App and menu interface - Someone mentioned in a review that all app menus were universally similar on the Apple TV. I found this to not be the case. As with any other device, Hulu, Netflix, Amazon and HBO all have their unique functionality.Up Next Feature - does not really work as advertised. I find it to be intermittent. Not all shows update like it said they would and not all appear on the home screen. Netflix specifically doesn't seem to play well with this feature, but overall each of the apps has failed to display the next episode of a show I have watched on the device.Quality and functionality - Quality and functionality is awesome. Content looks great and I have had few issues. Make sure you have an HDMI cable rated for 4k content or you will receive a warning (evidently I had an older one connected). The Apple TV connects easily to my iPhone for typing, filling in account fields and setting up. You can also download the Remote app from iTunes (to your phone) in order to use your phone as a remote, but I don't actually find this very convenient or helpful as I am perfectly happy with the remote.Biggest Con - Users of Bose Cinemate 130 beware. Evidently this system will not work with the Apple TV 4k. While I am able to connect sound from my Apple TV to the Bose system via direct input into the TV, I was not able to connect through the Bose Receiver. This is apparently a known issue to Bose, but they have no intention of fixing the issue leaving those of us that spent a significant amount of money to fend for ourselves. This was nearly devastating when I was trying to setup but thankfully I found a forum that directed me to a workaround.Summary - Overall I am quite happy with my purchase. I'm hoping after more updates the up next field is more accurate as it is pretty great to not need to jump into individual apps when your watching a series. I am also hopeful that eventually Spotify will be available via the Apple TV, but so far it isn't an option for download. Otherwise this is a great device that's easy to use and so much more reliable than the apps loaded into my Samsung Smart TV. Oh, and almost forgot to mention the screensaver. The photos (especially the aerial images) really are mesmerizing as another reviewer mentioned. My friends almost always comment about the cool images on the TV when they walk in, so just a minor added bonus if you needed one .","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2019","J.

"So much better than the previous versions","So much better than the previous versions. Streaming 4K HDR works far better than through my Sony 930e with no delay or audio problems, which were extremely frustrating. I have noticed a number of people posting issues with making the HDR connection. Apple TV does this during the set up, and it didn't work at first. There are three things (at least) that you might want to check if you cannot establish the 4K HDR connection. First, make sure your HDMI cables are high speed cables. Second, if you are connecting directly from Apple TV to your TV and not through your receiver, make sure that your advanced settings on your TV are set to ""Enhanced"" or ""Full"" or some other equivalent in the ""external connections"" setting. Lastly, your receiver likely has a specific mode for high speed connections. My Yamaha TSR 5810 has two modes, select the appropriate high speed mode. Once connected, it is flawless.

I tried to log into my Apple account using voice recognition, but it can’t distinguish a “p” from a “b”.

"Simply the Best out there especially if you use PS vue and you want the best picture & sound.","I've used most of the streaming boxes out there, too bad for me I bought this one last. Apple 4k TV is actually as good as it gets. If you're cord cutting I would suggest you go with this even if your not cutting the cord you should still get this, Cable TV can't even compete with the user experience you get with this. I was using the other popular streaming boxes out there, they are slow and lack features and just don't seem to work like they should. The Interface is simple to use but at the same time looks terrific. It loads apps fast like in 2 seconds your up and watching Ps Vue. 4 simultaneous streams wow the other streaming boxes struggle with one stream and take forever to load. The Picture and sound quality is awesome. This thing actually works even with Dolby Atmos I have it hooked to my Surround System and it controls it perfectly turns it on and controls the volume all that stuff that you would think they all should do really easily but they don't. I actually like the remote works great for me not even going to hook another remote up to it. I can actually put all the other remotes away now. Only bad thing is now I have to buy more for my other TV's. Apple really got this product right it's really close to perfect. It actually makes looking for things to watch on TV enjoyable. I really wish I would have tried this one first would have saved me lots of frustration. I'm no Apple fan boy either I'm a fan of whoever makes the best products that work for me. Only other Apple products I own are their Tablet's. Maybe I should be looking at apple products first in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2019","Geo",63

This is annoying. I have a Roku in another room that was half the price and never has had a problem.The remote is also annoying. It's small and the touch pad on it causes unwanted selections pretty much every time it's used.

"If you don't have 4k, it isn't worth the upgrade.","I purchased this box as an additional unit for a non-4k tv.We have a Roku Stick and a last-generation apple TV. We have zero issues with them as far as buffering or storing apps. I don't play video games on it, so I can't say if there's a difference in that area.We have no technical issues with this new Apple TV either. But it does cost a LOT more than the previous gen. By the time we upgrade to a 4k tv in a couple of years, this thing will probably be dated. If I could do it over, I wouldnt buy this version of Apple TV. It's not bad, it's just not worth the money since I don't have 4k.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2019","Bob from Accounting",64
"Good product - but nothing special","Like all Apple products, this is a beautifully constructed device that is consistently reliable. We like - no LOVE - that. Reliability matters and is almost the whole ball game. However, if we're talking about the overall user experience (which also matters a great deal), that's where this falls short a bit. When binging a favorite show, I often want to go back to a prior episode and Apple doesn't make this as seamless as it seams to do everything else. Maybe it's because I'm still relatively new to the Apple ecosystem but I can't easily figure out how to get to the episode list screen. I get a ""Watch Now"" button for the episode that I'm currently viewing, or I can scroll down to watch other shows, Aaaarghhhh. It's almost like Apple forces you to watch every episode in succession. My friends all tell me, ""Once you get used to it, you're going to love it."" But with other systems, it's intuitive and very easily done. And, by the way, they never explain how to resolve my issue.The quality of the product along with its consistent reliability is its saving grace. That's why I'm giving it 4 stars, not 3.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2022","Tony Tone",64

Definite improvement over the old gen, and despite the numerous negative reviews, I have generally been happy with the remote. The touch interface isn't perfect but far more convenient than the old remote. Plus using siri to type search fields is much easier then on screen typing.On a side note.

"Okay but some issues","Purchased this to be able to load apps since my 1st generation AppleTV didn't have that capability. So, I have learned this: you can load Hulu, but it's not Hulu+. Apple requires that you stick with the trial subscription for a month, and Hulu won't let you purchase Hulu+ until that trial is over. As far as functionality, the interface seems confusing but I'm getting used to it. Likewise the controls. Still getting used to the way it scrolls. And the screen saver is nice, but there's a big Airplay message square floating around on it. I still haven't figured out how to get Airplay to work, though it worked fine on the old one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2021","Katie Karns",64
"The first time I've ever been underwhelmed by an Apple product","I had high hopes for the Apple TV, I have everything Apple in my life already and have obviously come to expect a high level of quality from Apple products. Unfortunately I feel like this Apple TV 4K just isn't up to their standards and certainly not worth the price.Installation was straight forward and happened without issue, after using this product for about a month now I have noticed at least a couple time a week that the Apple TV will just freeze up on me, I know it's not my TV because when I change the input to something else, all is well. While the picture quality is beautiful on 4K TVs, a product that is constantly freezing up is inexcusable.I contacted customer support for Apple and they were not very helpful, they recommend performing a hard reboot of the Apple TV as well as checking for software updates. Both failed to resolve the issue. When contacting them again they said that it is most likely my TV that is causing the trouble - something I find hard to believe since my TV has functioned flawlessly with everything else - and to blame a TV for a device that is supposed to seamlessly integrate into any TV is just ridiculous.I should have gone with the ROKU...","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2018","C.T.",64

The voice recognition is still very good; but the swipe features are horrific when trying to use with any application not built by Apple. This is especially frustrating in YouTube and YouTube TV in trying to scroll forward or backward. Or to navigate within the folders that you have in your YouTube account. At least once a day we pull out the original AppleTV remote (that thankfully still works with latest generation) to be able to move around in the navigation.For a company as smart and as polished as Apple - this is a serious failure in User Experience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2020","Jason G.

It is easy to miss the mark you want. Frankly I like the older remote with press buttons better. If I am on a non apple site, the voice recognition doesn't help and says they don't know what I want. It is easier usually to not use it at all. The instructions in general could have been plainer and more detailed, typical I find for a lot of products coming from China.

"Love/Hate Relationship","WHAT I LOVE:-Apple has more 4K rentals than Roku, and any other on-demand provider-User Interface is intuitive and in beautiful 4K-Siri has never been more useful pulling up movies and tv shows on demand-Netflix and Amazon 4K content looks terrific-Supports Bluetooth headphones and doesn’t have audio lag when watching movies-Apple remote is WiFi based, and doesn’t require line of sight to operateWHAT I HATE:-Apple Remote layout is unintuitive and the built-in touch surface often lags and kills the user experience. Also, I can’t figure out why they couldn’t add “previous/next” buttons. If you watch movies with the lights off, you have to double check you’re not holding the remote upside down and push the wrong buttons. This is Apple TV’s biggest weakness is the poorly designed remote.-YouTube on Apple TV still doesn’t support 4K. Hopefully this gets fixed in an update.-Sometimes non hi-definition content through Netflix and Amazon Prime looks worse compared to their Roku versions. Hopefully this gets updated.-Compatibility with universal remotes is a nightmare. Using my WiFi based Logitech universal remote is nightmare. It works half the time. If the Apple TV has been off for a few hours, my Logitech remote wont be unable to power it on.-Cannot play content from a usb thumb driveCOMPARED TO 4K ROKUCOST OF 4K CONTENT: APPLE WINSI own a 4K TCL television with built-in Roku. It has decent movie selections for purchase, but very limited selection of 4K rentals.Roku movie rental prices can also be misleading. Sometimes you’ll see a cheap movie rental, only to discover the low price only applies to the HD version, and then you’ll see the 4K version requires you to buy the movie at full price.I should also point out, on a Roku device, movie rentals and purchases are done through third party apps like Vudu, Fandango, etc. I’m generalizing them all as Roku movies.I invested in Apple TV 4K because it offers more 4K rentals. I’m not a fan of purchasing 4K movies for $19.99.If Apple has a movie for sale that isn’t yet available to rent, they often show you the date when it will be available to rent. That’s just considerate.USER INTERFACE: APPLE WINSThis may seem like a petty complaint (and it is) but it annoys me that Roku menus aren’t in 4K. It doesn’t take advantage of the 4K resolution.REMOTE: ROKU WINSRoku’s remote is so much better than Apple TV. Layout is terrific. Mine came with my TV as Roku is built-in. The only downside Is it has dedicated buttons for apps that no one uses (like starz, sling, Hulu), and you can’t reassign those buttons to perform other functions.I wish my Roku TV came with the WiFi version of this remote as the IR signal is often getting blocked If I don’t line it up properly. But I will say it does play nicely with my WiFi Logitech universal remote.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2018","R. Siddiqui",66

The picture is great and the voice search works well.This might be really silly but I like that the unit doesn’t have an external DC adapter, it accepts a straight 120V cord so you don’t need to take up a bunch of room on a surge strip.The only issue I’ve had has been that the AppleTV frequently will not wake up when turning on the TV or pressing buttons on the remote. I’ve had to unplug the power and plug it back in again to get it going. The AppleTV seems very hot when this occurs but it’s in a location with plenty of ventilation. This issue has been troublesome enough that I deducted two stars.One other item that hasn’t been much of a nuisance is the fan noise.

"Compared to our older model apple tv: Awesome!","I got this for my fiance for a Christmas gift. I wasn't sure how much we would like it compared to our older apple tv, but our older one did not allow you to download additional apps, so we wanted to upgrade. I am actually much more impressed than I thought I would be. The remote is a much better design than the old remote. It has an area where you slide left and right, and you can also click on this area as well. It's actually pretty intuitive imo, compared to old remote. The built in siri is really a game changer. We can ask it to play any show or movie, and it brings up all all of the different options of apps to play it on. No more searching through Netflix, then Hulu, then Amazon, etc etc to see if the movie you want to watch is available. The best part however, is that the remote can be used to change the volume on the tv! We lost our tv remote a long time ago and have gone without it. Our old apple tv did not allow you to change volume. So this is really a pleasant surprise. So glad we upgraded.

Accidentally brushing against the remote, even lightly, will result in on-screen actions happening.

I told the person that I spoke to that their posting was misleading. Nowhere did it ever mention refurbished or used. It was in like new condition so I can’t complain about that BUT...the power cord was missing. When I contacted Amazon, they said they could not provide a cord and then they offered a discount or that I could return it. I responded that I would consider the discount, provided I could purchase a replacement cord. It was a little frustrating when I called back to take their offer, the next person I spoke to would only authorize half the discount I was originally offered. It was eventually corrected and I did buy a new power cord. The device worked fine but the previous owner’s login information was still in the machine. Another call to the support desk resolved that issue quickly enough. It dies work great now. But the process to get to this place was frustrating.The device gets 5 stars.

"Great product, good features, mediocre remote","I have read several reviews and can't understand why people revere the remote. I usually find apple products to be intuitive and easy to use. While the voice recognition is excellent, the touch pad is awkward. I've used this new apple TV for a few weeks and I can't get used to the advance feature; it's definitely not ""apple easy"". Also, the Remote App on the phone doesn't always connect easily.Among the good: unlike other streaming devices, this unit turns on and off by sensing the TV through the HDMI. It's got a lot of memory, a feature that I have yet to use or need (you may want to consider that it's not necessary to buy the 64GB version, as I did).

"Wow","I have a ton of streaming devices, but this is my go-to now because it is the only one that I have that has both Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision and the iTunes store movies have the best price and all the movies you buy on it get a free 4k/Atmos upgrade if the movie comes out in those modes.When you click on a text box on the screen you instantly get a notification on your phone that lets you type with your phone's keyboard. Single sign-in means that you don't have to keep entering in your tv provider and password to watch stuff like HBO and Showtime.I never thought I would find a better streaming device than a Xbox one X but once I got this, I never went back.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2019","Matt",68

I’ve finally figured it out, but it’s just not “Apple” to me.Lastly, there is not enough tactile distinction between the touchpad and the rest of the remote.

"Great buy if you have a big iTunes movie library - otherwise poor value.","My first Apple product, but decided to return it. It is a very high quality and powerful streaming device but poor value if you have little iTunes content.Offers 4K, HDR and Dolby Vision. Dolby Atmos will be available with TVOS 12 in this fall 2018. I upgraded to the Beta TVOS 12 and that did provide Dolby Atmos through the VUDU app, but there was no iTunes content with Atmos at the time of my testing.I have a Denon 12 speaker Dolby Atmos system connected to an LG OLED TV which also provides 4K, HDR, and Dolby vision, and Dolby Atmos, through the same streaming apps - VUDU, NETFLIX, Amazon, etc,, although NO iTunes access. I also use Nvidia Shield for all my local content since the Nvidia provides full Lossless bitstream audio passthough. The Apple TV only provides lossy audio, or PCM, and it appears there are no plans to change that.The only substantial benefit to this ATV would be access to iTunes, but I have no native iTunes content. I was attracted to the Apple policy of atomatically updating any HD content to UHD. I do have a large VUDU collection linked to my MoviesAnywhere account, and that content did appear in my iTunes list, with the UHD versions (purchased in VUDU) appearing in iTunes as UHD, but all the other content remained as HD. The auto upgrade only applies to HD purchased via iTunes.This meant any HD to UHD upgrades would need to purchased anew. That works fine with VUDU, but iTunes would not allow me to purchase UHD versions of HD movies that were listed in my MoviesAnywhere account, it simply said I already owned HD and would not upgrade. Unlinking my MoviesAnywhere account made no difference, and ""deleting"" iTunes movies doesn't delete them but merely hides them, and that still prevented an upgrade. There was a trick that partially worked - you can gift a movie to yourself - this did indeed result in a UHD upgrade but it left my MoviesAnywhere entry for that movie as HD - sigh.Apple appears to be agressively adding new UHD content to iTunes, including upgrades to many older movies, perhaps more agressive than VUDU. Apple prices also appear competetive or lower than VUDU. But each company seems to have different deals with the studios. Apple has no Marvel UHD at this point - e.g. Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor, etc. VUDU has all those. And similarly for Lucasfilm - iTunes doesn't have UHD The Last Jedi, etc. All this might well change in the future of course. Each company offers a different selection of UHD content, but I suspect both will offer the same eventually, just like HD evolved. My movie choices easily favored VUDU which offered a greater UHD selection. VUDU also has the distinct advantage of running on almost any streaming device, whereas iTunes is severely limited. I couldn't see any significant benefit for a new investment in the Apple ecosystem for the occasional UHD movie not available on VUDU - I can wait.If you have significant iTunes content then the auto HD to UHD upgrades is a great deal and makes the Apple TV 4k a very good choice. If like me you have no iTunes content, then the ATV is an expensive unecessary item. Also if you have a Dolby Vision smart TV then you will have all the streaming Apps native to the TV making the Apple TV unnecessary, assuming you have no iTunes content.The touch pad remote though is horrific, fortunetaly my LG TV remote worked perfectly well on the Apple TV.The aerial screensaver is very nice - not sure it is worth the $180 price tag.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2018","Cris Barrows",69

"Premium streaming box, Only recommended for Apple centric people","This Apple TV is a beatifully engineered piece of hardware, it is a premium product at $199 for an over the top streaming box. Like all Apple hardware, the more of it you own, the more exponentially useful it will be to you. On the surface, someone could be hard pressed to find the value in this Apple TV. It's 3x-4x the price of similar products from Amazon and Roku, and at the end of the day it doesn't do much more besides playing games a lot better than any streaming box besides the Nvidia Shield TV (which has Nintendo Switch internals). But there is more to this device than that in my opinion.The A10X is an aging chip, but it's still leagues beyond what you would find inside Amazon or Roku's highest end devices. This allows you to play any games that support TVOS and primarily Apple Arcade which has something for everyone. You will need a controller for this, but Playstation and Xbox controllers are now supported. They look great on the big screen and the performance is really snappy. The Apple TV 4K actually has active cooling, this is not at all common for devices like this to have a fan.The other chief difference in this product is how it handles your data. Most TV streaming hardware is sold at a loss or for no profit and they make it up with the Ad revenue that they earn from tracking everything you watch and displaying ads to you. This Apple TV 4K has zero 3rd party ads of any kind and it collects as little data as possible, especially compared to Roku, Google, and Amazon. And Apple has only been increasing their protection of their users for privacy violating trackers. The App store on here has the same nutrition label privacy cards as what you see on iOS/MacOS for every app. In short, if you value you your online/digital privacy, this is the only streaming device that is worth owning.This also ties into a lot of Apple services like Photos, Podcasts, Music, Arcade. And it syncs it all up through iCloud. You can use your photos as a screen saver if you want, but the other ones are much better. There are some that are aerial views from the ISS, updated all the time. The screensavers are actually quite amazing on here.As a final note, I would like to point out that this device is now 3 years old, it will probably be refreshed with a new product in the coming months. If you don't care about playing games on your Apple TV and you need a new one now, then I think it's fine to still buy this model. The next one will probably have an A14 or A12Z chip on board, but this model is plenty capable for streaming 4K HDR content.If you are not deep into the Apple hardware ecosystem, you might not get the full $179-199 value from this product. If you are though, this product will not disappoint you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2021","Solid Snake",71

"Great picture quality but the remote ...","I've been a huge Apple fan for the last ten years. I bought the 4K Apple TV to replace my Amazon FireTV. As with all Apple products the setup is as smooth as it gets, the video quality is amazing and beats the FireTV easily. But I returned it because the remote is too complicated to use. The touchpad just sucks, it makes it difficult to navigate in the menu, sometimes you press the touchpad accidentally and end up in a different menu or start a movie you don't want to watch. This is not what I'm expecting from an easy-to-use and intuitive product. The remote takes away all the fun and benefits that come with the AppleTV.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2019","Carl Cabbage",72

"Excellent for TV and games","Apple TV is an excellent product by all means. It permits playing games using the remote or pairing with a joystick (bought separately). All major streaming players are there, and the image quality is great.I had the previous Apple TV generation; putting programmed obsolescence aside, some may say this new version doesn’t seem to be a great breakthrough, especially because the user interface of the main menu is similar to the previous generation. But this resemblance stops here; at the moment you start opening Apple TV embedded apps and other apps, everything is different.I also have Google Chrome attached to my TV, but the Apple TV usability is better. Having to keep your mobile phone on your hand to access the TV isn’t a good idea at all... in particular if you use work’s phone (certainly a call for trouble).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2020","Amazon Customer",73

I bought this to replace our firetv stick that was driving me crazy, I hated the inconsistent UI of Amazon’s TV offerings. How apps would change places or disappear completely having to be searched for, and old apps no longer being used would seemingly stick around forever. Having control over where I place the apps, and the lack of ads compared to the amazon stick is a breath of fresh air. The remote is nice, sometimes I scroll farther than I meant to, but I think there’s a slight learning curve in using it.

"Would have given a 5 star except for the horrible remote.","I'm not sure what Apple was thinking when they designed the remote. All the other comments about the horrible remote are absolutely true! Everything else about the AppleTV 4K is 5 star! But oh that remote. In fact I also bought an NVidia Shield and I actually prefer using the Shield simply because I can't stand the AppleTV remote. I wish they had a regular remote that you could purchase. I would and I'd throw the one that comes with it in the garbage. This remote ranks with up there with the charge port on the bottom of the Mac mouse. Sometime you have to wonder if they aren't on something over there in Cupertino! :)Update: Did I say I can't stand the remote. Let me say it again. It's the WORST.

"Search Feature By Voice is Worth the Price Alone","I have this newer model of Apple TV and I have the older model on two other t.v.s. I am planning on upgrading all of my t.v.s to the newer model of Apple TV.What I like:1. The new remote style vice the old style.2. You can do search by your voice rather than having to use a keyboard or scrolling on a remote.3. You can choose which Apps you want on it rather than having all of them displayed.4. You can charge the remote via USB.What I dislike:1. The apps will occasionally freeze up and you have to delete it and reinstall it. I primarily notice this with the YouTube app.2. It doesn't always recognize my accent, but Alexa and Siri also have an issue with understanding accents too so this isn't unique to Apple.3. The remote sometimes (rarely) doesn't recognize touch when you try to swipe on the top part of it. But this is so rare that it's really just a matter of inconvenience.What I don't like is so minor that's it's really not even worth mentioning.

"Avoid this product.","This was a bad experience with such a device. Major problems were centered around Netflix. Constant spoiling of programs. Menus for series as well as movies was fairly fast only 20% of the time. Very, very often the screen would freeze or lose contact with the server. Unplugging the Apple TV sometimes got everything working again. I would sometimes have to do this 5 times in the course of a days viewing.

"Apple TV 4K is finally compelling for iOS users","If you're all-in on the Apple ecosystem, this works very well. Essentially it's an iPhone that's not portable. The 4K output works well, and the apps for different channels is, as you'd expect from Apple, very well integrated. The remote is brilliant, but puzzling at first until you realize the top is actually a mouse pad, and you can click it like a mouse. I have to admit, I needed to read the directions for that.I purchased this for the Apple Homekit, and I'm still learning of the limitations. Right now, I'm on the hunt for an app that lets this work a bit easier than trying to build things on an iPhone.Apple is slowly, but surely, turning the Apple TV into something worthwhile. The addition of 4K and the Apple Homekit make this appealing to those who are all-in on Apple. if you're not, the Amazon FireTV is worth a look, as the interface is arguably a bit more intuitive if you're not familiar with iOS","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2018","TomK1",78

"WORST APPLE PRODUCT EVER!!! THATS A FACT. READ ALL THE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING","Let me preface this review by saying I am and have always been a big fan of apple products...they just seem to work great and everything works with everything else. I have iPhone's, iPad's, MacBook's, iMac's and the last generation of AppleTV...NO problems with any of it, just how it should be. On to my review.FIRST: The remote...what was apple thinking about when they released this piece of junk remote? No back, forward, up or down buttons, you must swipe your finger across the blank top of the remote to use any of these functions. If you are holding the remote any way but straight and level where your selection will go is anyones guess. If you touch it the wrong way when you pick it up its hard to say what will happen, never the same thing twice. HUGE learning curve trying to use this disaster of a remote.SECOND: Picture quality is terrible (I have a top of the line 65"" OLED TV by the way), the HDR processing is atrocious with digital blocking, soap opera looking picture and general digital noise. I have tried a brand new hi-speed cable, every video setting available on both the TV and the AppleTV to no avail...picture is almost unwatchable. I also have a 4K FireTV box and when I switch to the FireTV the picture is great, switch back to the same program on the AppleTV and there is no doubt that the AppleTV's picture is REALLY BLOCKY AND NOISY. The picture sometimes just goes black or comes up with a gray/blue/purple mish mash of static, not all the time just whenever it wants to.THIS ITERATION OF APPLETV IS BEING RETURNED. HOPEFULLY I WILL BE ABLE TO BUY ANOTHER 4K VERSION WHEN THEY GET IT RIGHT...UNTIL THEN BYE BYE 4K APPLETV.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2019","James H.",78

However I dislike that when renting a movie you have the movie for 30 Days however from the time you press play you have 48 hours to watch the movie and it’s gone. So you’re not really getting your 30 days.... other than that I love watching Netflix and Hulu on this device and I most of all like that I can go to my Apple Music right on the tv versus having to constantly search YouTube. Which reminds me! When searching/typing it’s very inconvenient to have to slide across and choose them individually. Very time consuming. I like that my phone can connect but no one else’s can so all my guest must type slowly. I love mirroring my phone to the tv to show people stuff tho!

"A high quality streaming device at an even higher price.","The Apple TV 4K has a nice solid build but unless you are an Applephile it can be bothersome in function for the sake of simplicity when it comes to turning it on the first time and downloading what you want. For streaming it loads pretty quickly but I was expecting lightning fast processing. It may be an issue of apps needing to be better streamlined. When the Apple TV 4K goes to sleep sometimes it gets hung up on itself when you turn it back on with blank icons, images, and missing information so you have to hit the Menu button to try and get it to reload. I tried a Roku Ultra prior to this and while this is faster it wasn't as fast as I was expecting. I have everything connected through ethernet (wired) so my internet speed is more than enough and you'll want yours set up the same way. Wireless should be good if you have fast enough speed. I had to set up an iTunes account just to be able to download apps on this thing, otherwise it locks you out from ""purchasing"" (downloading) apps. You have to purchase every app, even the free ones, so you need an Apple ID but it will not be complete without an iTunes account. Yeah, I'm one of the few people who doesn't have an iPhone or have iTunes as my go to music downloading software.The user interface is nothing special, but some people prefer it that way with just the icons for apps and settings. I haven't found a use for the Apple ""TV"" app, it seems to be based more on suggestions for things you have already downloaded. It's supposed to sync all of your apps and payment information for anything you pay for to stream. The Siri remote is decent for volume control as it uses your TV's infrared signal, it has Siri voice control which I've heard is awful so I don't use it at all. There is a menu button that functions as basic menu selecting and as a Back button. The home button selects either the Apple TV app or the main menu hub based on your options selection. There is a Play/Pause button, and a horrible touchpad instead of directional keys. You click on it for selections, but it's a real pain when watching a show and you want to fast forward or rewind. The easiest way to do this is to click on the direction you want at the end of the pad and keep clicking continuously. You can swipe with you fingers/thumb to proceed faster but it's easy to overshoot. There are options for touchpad tracking speed but it didn't make much difference in functional quality. I have it set on Fastest and it may take you a bit to get used to. I am being critical because it should have been better designed considering the cost for this streaming device.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2019","Silver Phoenix",80

"Fixes a problem that doesn’t exist","I’ve had my my Apple TV for 6 months and have to say it can b buggy….for exampleI’ve had to reset it twice because it stoppedPlaying audio through the HomePod. Although, it looks like Apple fixed that bug.Additionally, it tries to be too minimalistic, hence that creates quirks and to my surprise the voice recognition on my Sony TV works infinitely better….the Sony can search for and take me to shows within apps, Apple TV doesn’t do this.On the plus side ATV can detect TV’s on ur Wi-Fi network and the remote app on ur phone can control them, although w a minimalist design.The stream and audio quality r good. I have the ATV hooked up to my bedroom LG (can’t remember the model) playing through a HomePod. I can’t tell the difference between a show being sourced from my LG or the Apple TV device. I did try hooking it up to my Sony in the living room and while the pic quality was the same, the Sony’s audio processing sounds better through the surround system. Plus, the Sonys just so much easier to navigate ( I can get Apple TV + through my Sony too) and much quicker in general.What I find truly bizarre is u can’t adjust Siri’s voice volume which it can be completely out of whack w the audio level coming from ur program.So, this is my question….do u need an Apple TV box? Additionally, when I ask Siri to turn off the TV, the latter is not as reliable as an Alexa device. The biggest plus w the Apple TV box is it acts as an Apple Homekit hub. Aside from that it just adds another step for watching tv.I think what really let’s this device down is the remote. Whether it’s the previous gen w the touchpad or the new one w a ‘mute’ button, the remote’s just too small to be practical.Here’s the big irony: I like my ATV box but if it wasn’t there I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t notice and I’m not so sure about it’s value proposition.

"Great streaming device, but not so great remote design","The remote is my only real complaint for this device. It is immediately recognized by all my other Apple devices as a screen sharing or audio device. It handles 4k video without a hiccup. All the major video streaming apps work and it's faster than my older 4k Roku ultimate. Just being able to throw content from my iPhone or queue up YouTube videos makes this a seamless experience. I just wish the remote was designed a little differently. It's too thin and the whole top of it is a button which makes it impossible to pick up sometimes without pressing the button or moving the selection because the button is also a touch interface. I like the ability to use my voice to search with it, but that's the only redeeming factor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2020","D. Villella",83

"PERFECT for 4K TVs! Must have.","I bought a 4K TV and was using my regular Apple TV 4th gen with just 1080p quality. After a day I decided I needed better picture quality! I love tvOS and how smoothly it operates. I knew the 4K Apple TV was a must have. Netflix, Hulu, ESPN, and many other apps run MUCH better on the Apple TV than they do on the pre-installed apps on the smart TV. I love this Apple TV, and I love the quality of it.

"BOSS Screensavers are the best part.","I love a lot about this streaming box in terms of the apps you can access, and have been an Apple devotee forever, but I must say the oversimplified streamlined apple design suffers a little bit from the same syndrome that the original iPods had, with all this wild scrolling around. It takes a marksman’s eye and the patience of a saint to navigate all over the place with this silly remote. However, the screensavers are extraordinarily beautiful, hypnotic, and make life better. They are taken with drones and helicopters at beautiful cities around the world from Dubai to Los Angeles.I’m a little upset that I can’t run Spotify on this platform, presumably because Apple doesn’t want to cut into its marketshare by hosting a competitor’s music streaming service. So I’ve actually caved in and re-opened my Apple premium streaming account (against my better judgment), just because it’s so great to be able to listen to music and watch the screen savers at the same time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2018","Shakt1",88
"Really useful for cutting the cable cord","Overall, we really like the Apple TV 4K as a media access device. Good range of apps for access to content. We use YouTubeTV as our main content provider. The remote takes a bit of getting used to (adjust tracking to slow for more control). The main beef I have with it stems from an option we have on our main smart TV - it includes a web browser, which is great for accessing content from sources that don't have apps. We are able to easily watch videos from websites full screen on our main TV. Apple expects you will use the Apple TV via WI-FI (I preferred wired connection for more reliability for HD content), so using Airplay to play a website from a nearby computer or iOS device isn't an option. That is the main reason I gave it only four stars. One other nice convenience, I had a spare Bluetooth keyboard, so when I do searches, I have a full keyboard that is far easier than the standard search interface.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2019","WileEC",88

"Great Video Quality; Challenging Remote","the biggest thing that stands out to me with the AppleTV is the video quality. I have a 4K TV and have been using other streaming devices and have been happy with them. However, I ordered this to get the AppleTV Plus streaming service and am impressed with the improved quality of the video. In fact, I told the wife I no longer wanted to buy another TV since the improved picture is like getting a new one. This is the quality we should have had for a long time.Another feature I like is the unified menu when using the AppleTV app. I don’t have to go into individual apps now. I can find the shows/movies I want within the single AppleTV app. When I find what I want to watch, it takes me to the app it is located in. Goodbye to having to remember of what streaming service my shows/movies are on!One thing that I am not impressed with is the remote. The touchpad takes a while to get used to. I did buy a little silicon case so it’s easy to determine the orienatation of the remote but using the touchpad can be a pain to navigate.

"Tremendous box, easy to set up","The Apple 4K TV is a great device, but it is coupled with a difficult to use remote. The remote needs to be in contact with the device via Bluetooth I believe. This means that shouldn’t be located in another room, you may have reception problems. I’m top of that the navigation which is by finger pressure is imprecise and leads to Usage difficulty.

After researching other people who purchased the product, there are numerous instances out in the market that have had this same problem.I had to go to settings and restore to factory default and install updates. After several updates and several restarts, the product is now working as intended.

"Great Streaming Device. Highly Recommended (but DO NOT buy from Amazon)","Amazing menus. Works incredibly fast. Picture and sound quality is extremely beautiful and superior. Runs multiple apps at once, switches between them seamlessly without re-buffering. Siri does voice search in every app, (unlike Alexa of Fire TV which only works on Amazon content). Gigabit Ethernet port works great if you have access to hard line. But the wifi is super strong and stays connected (unlike the Fire TV). Incredibly useful Home App connects content from multiple (participating) apps. Displays ""Where You left off"" and ""Up Next"" thumbnails at the top of the Home Screen. Up Next being the next episode of a series you are streaming, or the new episode of a series you favorited in a cable app.The super slim remote is very advanced and handy. Only needs to be charged every 6 months or so.This is a great product. But I would recommend you buy it at an Apple Store, Wholesale Club (Costco, Sams, BJs), Best Buy etc. NOT AMAZON. The one they sent me was defective. It was not poor design. It was negligence on Amazon's part. They shipped this device in a bubble mailer envelope not a box. Good thing Apple handles the warranty. I was able to go to my Apple Store and get a new one under the warranty. It works brilliantly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2018","Misterbanks",90

"It has problems.","It is an elegant product, like most Apple products (even though competitors are leaving Apple in the dust lately on a lot of features for phones and computers. C’mon Apple! Gimme a touchscreen laptop and a better iPhone camera!). Menus are pretty on the Apple TV, though I hate the touchpad on the remote; I’d much rather have real buttons for navigating. I also find that the device is a bit slow for a 2019 piece of computer hardware. All this would be forgivable if there weren’t glaring problems with the picture quality of the content that apple is delivering. Depending on the source material, some movies look great after Apple’s conversion and some look absolutely awful. I’ve had to turn off the HDR in the Apple TV. I’ve read a lot of explanations on what Apple is doing to HDR10 movies vs. Dolby Vision movies, but I won’t bore you with it here. Suffice it to say that I expect ALL content being sent from the Apple TV to my brand new 4K Sony projector to look outstanding. Apple needs to get their sh** together. Everything does look very good coming from my 4K (non-HDR) Roku. If it weren’t for the fact that I’ve been stuck in the Apple ecosystem (desktops, laptops, iPhones) for a very long time (I started w/an Apple II Plus in 1979), I’d go with a cheaper alternative to the Apple TV 4K.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2019","mark g",90

"Great hardware with even better software provides a near perfect watching experience with not much to improve on.","Hands down the best user interface on any streaming device! Really liked the non-4K variant and this one is even better. Very responsive and the tilting effect applied to icons/artwork when scrolling is a nice little touch. HDR looks incredible. Aerial screensavers.. :)Remote does take some getting used to but I've come to enjoy using it. The one included with this model is slightly easier to use thanks to the tactile ring around the Menu button. Feels considerable better in the hand compared to other device remotes thanks to it's materials and build quality.One small complaint would be Apple not allowing more app developers to feature content on Siri suggestions or inside the TV app. Would be great if my Plex content could be accessed the same way Netflix or iTunes can. Maybe in the future an update will allow this but kind of doubt it.By far my top feature and reason for recommending would have to be the clean interface and home screen. Used a Nvidia Shield in the past which was okay but greatly prefer this. Tried the 4K Fire TV for not even a week before concluding that the constant suggestions/ads everywhere was not my thing (even as a Prime member).Though it probably doesn't matter much to most people I would have also liked support for Dolby Atmos and DTS-X audio formats. Apparently Dolby Atmos could be coming in the future over a software update though.Apple TV 4K has really improved my viewing experience especially when finding what to watch.

It is much smoother now and I get less frustrated with trying to input a password or email on the sign-in page. The clarity on a 4k television is amazing. I am so glad that Apple upscaled purchased movies into 4k for free! Awesome.The one issue that has come up (we have moved from the fast internet, like 1GB speed to slower speed, under 50mb) and playing 4k has become a bit more of a process. That isn't the Apple TV but mostly a commentary on scaling down to the slower internet. 4k really requires at least a consistent 25mb connection or there will be buffering which is a pain.

"Good system, but the remote is not very user friendly.","Much better than what we were using before, but still needs some work. First, the remote is too small and too slick to the touch. Bought a soft plastic case from Amazon which helps, but the remote remains somewhat limited. The Siri voice works better than we had been told by others, which is quite helpful since to maneuver around the Apple TV site takes some getting used to. For example, to resume a movie or show where you previously left off, is not very easy using the remote - but asking Siri works much better.

"Digitizes Stream","Overall, I guess we’re happy with the new Apple TV, but it has its drawbacks. Like everything Apple, I swear they don’t do any real life user interface testing. They drop the features you like and add a bunch of stuff that’s no longer intuitive or just more difficult. Don’t even get me started on AppleTV+ service!Additionally, the picture quality in dark areas is often digitized. I’ve seen comments from others on this, too. What? This is for 4K. So, if you don’t have the optimal equipment setup, expect below average results.Some features on the remote are a step up (voice control, turning TV on along with AppleTV box, including volume control), others are frustrating or just not intuitive (search, messing with the menus, turning unit off).","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2021","Jeff P",109

"When it works... Otherwise, POS","When this thing works, I'm quite happy with it, otherwise...I returned the little black box and received a replacement about 3-4 months ago, the original just quit working. Good service.Now, the replacement has to be unplugged, (not just turned off) regularl,y otherwise it starts locking up or slowing streaming way down or stopping. Aside from that it also seems to generate a lot of heat, it becomes quite warm. Maybe if they built in a cooling fan it might help.Latest problem, the Remote. The switches are failing to operate about 40% of the time. And, as AppleTV encourages game play, a malfunctioning controller causes extreme stress rather than enjoyable relaxation. Can't tell you haw many times i've almost thrown the device through my wall display or tossed it on the floor and jumped up and down on it.Now I'm annoyed because i've just come to Amazon to try to get them to replace the controller only to find out that they quit supporting it a couple of months ago. Now I have to spend $50+ to buy a new one!!Bottom Line: When it's all working I really like the product, otherwise...POS!!","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2020","ObiRon",117

"we have to reboot Apple TV first thing in the morning because something is frozen up between it and our beautiful Samsung TV","I have two main beefs and 1 minor beef with Apple TV:1. On a large TV, the icons are so big that they don’t automatically efficiently use all the available real estate. This makes navigation harder than it needs to be, because you have to scroll down to see some icons, that kind of thing.2. Many days, we have to reboot Apple TV first thing in the morning because something is frozen up between it and our beautiful Samsung TV. It only takes a minute, but minutes add up, and it’s not like we have to do it once a month. It’s more like several times a week.3. This is a personal preference, but I find the generic menu to be fairly bland. I haven’t played with Settings to figure out what options there are to make it much more beautiful or interesting, but the default settings are boring. The has minimal to do with functionality, but seems like such an easy fix. Of course what one person likes, another person might hate.....","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2018","Portland Guy",118

"The worst remote every invented, period. Don't want their subscription - poor experience.","I don't know what Apple were thinking when they designed the remote for this 4k device but it is utterly dreadful, try skipping ahead 10 seconds... no chance, it will pause, un-pause or completely do something else anytime you just look at the remote. The touch pad area is just a joke. I had to either sell this and go back to a Roku or get a knock-off remote, which is coming soon but I'm done with it. The other huge negative is if you aren't an Apple TV subscriber then the experience is poor, for example if you're watching Fridge via Amazon Prime, it will show you the next episode to watch but it will be from another channel, not your Prime channel. So all recommendations etc are a fail. The Apple TV as a service has failed, I don't want it even if it's free and it's free that's how bad it is. It's another channel aggregator... with a garbage truck remote.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2021","Craig Williams",122

"Works - sorta - could be worse, but room for improvement in all corners. Marginally better than just airplay on gen3 AppleTV","Its 'ok' - in that all of the bugs from the ATv gen 3 are fixed (since Apple isn't updating the older firmware and those older units will start hanging up after streaming a few things). The interface though- focused on flashy graphics that add little value, and the remote is a disaster.Programmed the IR codes into my universal remote and that helps. The Apple silly notion of hard coding some things (mark all as watched) as a 'long press' which cannot be programmed into a universal remote, is still an issue. But hey, one gets a native YouTube app back (that was removed from the 3rd gen. Still, that app is demonstrably worse than the native iOS app on the phone, so one trades phone battery life (by not having to airplay) for a janky new interface that is out of sync with reality. <sigh> If only the big tech companies with all the 'smart people' could write some decent software for a change, that would great, m'kay.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2018","Thomas S.",125

"Received a unit with outdated software version-Won't Play NETFLIX","I just received my new Apple TV player today. Even though this is the ""latest model"" available it would not load or play the NETFLIX app. After calling Apple support I learned I had to go into settings and update the version of the software that came on this player. Now Netflix and all other apps work fine, but I spent a lot of extra time and frustration trying to get to the bottom of the problem. So, I have learned that just because something is the ""latest model"" does not mean it is the latest version. If I had known I would have purchased directly from Apple and not gone through Amazon.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2021","MRS",126

"Directvnow works great on this box","We purchased this to try with the Directvnow streaming service. We previously had been using a Roku Premiere which we found very glitchy and it had slow response time. The Apple TV 4 K box is a huge upgrade. Directvnow works great on this box, the guide is very very fast and almost no instances of the dreaded spinning square from buffering. That happened frequently with Roku. All of the other streaming services and apps work well also and I love how the Apple TV app pulls content in from all of your subscribed sources (Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, HBO, Showtime, etc.). Yes this is several times more expensive than Roku but for us it's worth it for the improved experience. The Roku product was maddening. Combined with the Directvnow streaming service which is super cheap for ATT subscribers, it is an excellent alternative to cable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2018","James T",139

The only way to watch those show was to turn off the DV completely and use it in standard mode with some washed colors and blacks. Btw I have a top of the line 2019- Vizio PX65-G1.

So I don’t understand why Apple didn’t add the protection option were no one can reset the Apple except for the owner, let the owner install a pin so no one can reset it your Apple.

I bought it because it has Dolby Vision and wanted more apps. This streamer is definitely geared toward those who are Apple users. I found the whole user experience very frustrating and not very user friendly. In the end the Dolby Vision was not enough to off-set the overall user experience. I have an LG OLED smart-TV that produces the same quality Dolby Vision picture but will have to wait until they add more apps.

This Apple4k streaming box can't play 4k videos on YouTube, is not that interesting in 2020? Is not the user's fault nor is Google's, Apple wants to be so special everytime so they decide to use different codect then all others. You can play iTunes movies from a fire tv 4k if you buy them before on a pc, mac, or phone. Doing so they became available in the apple tv application installed on a fire stick.

"Extremely Disappointing Customer Experience","It is difficult to put into words my disappointment with Apple based on my experience with this product. To start, I have many Apple products and have always been very satisfied with, at the least, how Apple treats customers. I do believe that the core value of user centric design have been degraded in the post-Steve jobs era, but overall, I have been a satisfied Apple customer. Those days may be coming to an end.I purchased the Apple TV 4K in February of 2021. If the last two days had not occurred, I would have given a glowing review to this product. However, a couple of nights ago, I noticed the status LED was flashing rapidly and there way no output to HDMI. Suspecting a software update, I went to bed and left the unit alone. The following morning, the light was still flashing. I performed the known tests of rebooting the unit, trying a different HDMI cable and input, charging the remote, and trying to use the remote to reset the device. Seeing as how I could not get the HDMI output to work, reseting the Apple TV through the interface was a no go.So I contacted Apple and scheduled a support call. They confirmed what I already knew, and said it was either a software issue or a hardware issue. Innocently, I scheduled a time the next day to take the Apple TV 4K to the Genius Bar for troubleshooting. And here is where things went very wrong. The Genius Bar tech essentially repeated the troubleshooting I had already done, and then said they don't really repair Apple TV 4K, they just over to sell you a replacement at the same price as a new one, and they did not have one in stock to boot.And here is my problem, and where I see Apple failing to excel in several areas:1. Why not put a hard reset to factory default button in the hardware design? If you can't get to the UI, you can't reset the unit to factory defaults. If you use the menus, you can reset to factory defaults and no internet connection is required. This is a bad design decision, however one that may not have helped me.2. Why on earth would Apple send me down to the Apple store, wasting yet another hour of my time if they could not in fact, actually do any real additional troubleshooting? And on top of that, they do not really repair Apple TV 4K's at all? It makes no sense to waste the customer's time by making them spend even more time going to the Apple store when they full well know they can't fix an Apple TV 4K. If they had leveled with me before I wasted my time, I would have been much less disappointed in the whole experience.3. Unlike in the past, Apple had no interest in doing anything before me, besides selling me another full price Apple TV.Now I know for a fact you can repair Apple TVs 4Ks, provided the manufacturer will support repair by selling parts and chips. It appears Apple has chosen not to do this, which is both lame for right to repair, and ultimately contributes to wasteful consumerism where when something doesn't work, you just throw it in the garbage and buy another one. Apple is a hugely profitable company with billions of dollars in cash. Anything they wanted to do, they could do it. At the very least they could partner with some of the smaller repair shops for customers who want to repair their devices.Apple is choosing to tell a customer who owns tons of Apple products and has spent countless dollars on Apple products over the years that getting barely over a year out of a $150 piece of hardware is no big deal, and I should fork over more money to them as the solution to my problems. I have been invested in the Apple Ecosystem for a while, and have been planning to upgrade my MacBook because it is serval years old, as well as an eventual phone replacement. But Apple is falling down not thinking their design through, and taking a terrible approach to customer service. Apple used to be a standout brand in these areas, but apparently they want to be just a run of the mill company exploiting their brand name for money, the customer be damned.I guess roll the dice on this product if you like, but don't expect much out Apple if anything goes wrong.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2022","Tim Burke",148

"Adequate","Every time you exit an application now, it forces you into an intermediate screen that tries to guide your ""content selection strategy"" rather that going back to the mains screen - Basically slows down your navigation. This unit has problem with ""average HDMI"" cables which manifests as an intermittent lag with the performance of the remote control. Apple, if you need to upgrade the specs of your HW to get decent performance out of your products, try moving down from 500 to a 400% profit.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2018","Striker Fired",149

"Controller is a nightmare to use","We’ve had this several months and I decided to write a review because I hate the controller so much. The upgraded ‘box’ itself is fine although I sometimes wonder why I upgraded? The Wi fi connection seems better but honestly I could have just kept my old one.It’s the controller that’s so maddening. In their effort to make everything ‘slick’ and ‘cool’ Apple apparently never tested this thing with real people. It’s so small, thin and short it’s hard to hold in your hand and use. Replacing the familiar circular controller with a more touch screen effect doesn’t help. Worst thing though is the edges are literally so slick it jumps out of your hand like a wet frog. You basically have to set it down on a surface, like your couch arm, to use.Apple people: just because you can make it so small, should you? Your ergonomics engineer who singed off on this should be fired.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2021","Diana R. Vinci",153

"Best picture, interface, App consistency, forget the remote use App on iPad instead...","I had issues with the Roku 4K, and I found the interface clunky and old. I found the Apple TV 4K too expensive, so I got an Amazon Wharehouse deal on one for the same price as the Roku Ultra. The Apple interface is MUCH better, the App performance more consistent, and the picture is better — noticably. One star taken off for the remote, I have no frickin’ idea how Jony Ive thought the remote was ready for prime time. It’s a train wreck. The concept is great, but the touch area needs to be much bigger, and less sensitive. You get used to it, but it still can be frustrating at times. Siri works well enough, and the App consistency much better. The aerial screensaver is incredible!UPDATE: I finally downloaded the Apple TV Remote App for my iPad. Suddenly, the touch area for the remote is huge! While the App isn't perfect, it does make-up for some of the shortcomings of the remote. It seems less sensitive (good!), and vernally easier to use. Sadly, you can't do everything the real remote does, but that could change. The other con would be the functionality is a bit different for each, so I use the iPad most often. I bet the App improves from here. Earth to Jony Ive.

"The touch remote is terrible","I had an earlier generation apple TV and upgraded to this version solely so I could play my yoga app on the television through it (perhaps not the best reason to shell out $200). I'm extremely disappointed -- mostly in the remote, which has an overly sensitive touch component. I find it very difficult to navigate with this remote and am constantly selecting options I don't want -- and having a hard time figuring out how to undo some of them. I actually had to google how to undo subtitles after mistakenly selecting them from a drop down menu I couldn't get to reappear. The fix was easy, but I needed instructions to find it. The page layouts aren't intuitive to navigate through, either. Overall, I wish this were more user friendly and that I had more options as an iphone user.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2018","Baltibuymore",166

"Atmos on Netlix - DONT BUY","This is a horrible abomination. Takes hours to set up if you don't have an apple id and apple iTunes (you need both). God forbid you set up your apple accounts with a strong password, then it might take an entire day.So the specific reason I got this was to watch netflix in Atmos. Well it does do that for those few shows that have atmos but literally every other show on every other channel sounds worse than thr my much cheaper Roku. Why because this does not have audio pass thru. So your Atmos receiver doesn't get a chance to get all the other formats, like dolby 5.1, and process to make use of your atmos setup. Apple does the decoding and your atmos receiver can't.Let me restate this. This unit cannot pass Dolby 5.1 to your receiver, it can only pass 5.1 channels to your receiver.So cumersome user interface with the apps you use hidden below apple apps they want you to spend money on, horrible setup, and terrible audio support.Garbage.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2019","T",172

"Video freezing issue is maddening","I have a gen 2 that still works (actually better than this one). I bought this to take it RVing so I could stream from my phone to the Apple TV without a WiFi network. I ended up paying $10 more per month and making my phone a personal hotspot, so I haven’t taken it camping. However, this device has become virtually unusable in our den because of an odd glitch. When streaming Netflix or Amazon Prime, the video frame will either freeze, or just go black, and the audio will continue. We have invested a ridiculous amount of time rebooting the Apple TV, the router, switching from one app to the other, backing up or going forward a bit in the movie. Nothing seems to work. It is bug ridden. We’ve searched the web for solutions. Lots of people are experiencing the same problem, but I’ve not found anyone with a working solution. We don’t have any other form of TV other than streaming Netflix and Amazon, and the news apps. We end up going into the bedroom to use a Roku stick, which streams without issues.oddly, I can watch a movie from my phone or iPad and use the mirror feature and it will work fine. It’s just a hassle to use two devices when one should work. Since 2004 we’ve bought only Apple products, two 27” iMacs, a MacBook, tow iPhones and three iPads. I’m shocked That Apple has allowed this bug to go unresolved so long. It’s the first Apple product I wish I had never bought. I could have spent far less on Amazon fire or Roku and gotten better service.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2018","S. Gaither",172

"The Best","This is the best media streaming box of them all (and I’ve tried them all, believe me: Roku, Amazon, Chromecast, etc.) It’s got the easiest interface of any of them and has the most 4K compatibility of any of them. A recent software update now lets you choose to match the media contents original frame rate and dynamic range, so it doesn’t automatically upscale everything to Dolby Vision or HDR. Though if you keep it on Dolby Vison or HDR, the color of the menus, screensavers, and non-4K video content does REALLY pop. I recently bought a 4K UHD BluRay player to go along with my new system that I’m building because I thought that even the best streaming box in the world wouldn’t compare against a physical hard copy. And that’s more or less true, but the Apple TV 4K’s picture is so good that the difference between a hard copy of something and it’s cloud-based counterpart is just barely perceptible. That’s a huge compliment to the ATV 4K. Get this, even if you don’t have a 4K TV yet and future-proof your entertainment system.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2018","Andrew P.",174

"One of the more disappointing Apple purchases I have made ...","One of the more disappointing Apple purchases I have made. After purchasing a new 4K TV (Sony XBR-900E), the Apple TV 4K replaced a first generation Amazon Fire TV box that I purchased several years ago. Setup of the Apple TV 4K box was relatively straightforward, but the largest issue is that the box requires a reboot once or twice a day. The issue is when starting shows on the Netflix or Amazon Prime applications, the audio will start but video displays a black screen. The solution (found online) is to reboot the Apple TV box.Apple TV 4K was purchased to replace a Fire TV box that just worked. At the price point that Apple charges (double a Roku Ultra, Fire TV 4K), reboots are unacceptable.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2018","Eugene Ma",174

"Returned It & Bought a Roku","I have always had Roku streaming devices in the past but for some dumb reason I decided to buy an Apple TV instead of a Roku when I got fed up with the built in apps on my Samsung TV. The Apple TV worked fine for about 2 days but then on day 3 it would not turn on from the remote and I had to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to turn on (The remote was fully charged). And speaking of the remote, I know Apple is the cool kid and all but having a laptop trackpad style remote is just stupid. The movement from the trackpad is inconstant and unreliable. I would have paid extra for a remote with up, down, left, and right buttons rather than this thing.Because of the issue with the Apple TV not coming back from sleep mode I decided to disable sleep mode completely, after which I found that the apps would lock up at start. I ended up returning it and in the end I bought another Roku. I highly DO NOT recommend this product.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2020","Phil",180

"Absolutely the worst tv controller on the market","The hand held controller for Apple TV is the worst design ever from Apple. First, for seniors the touch pad design is a disaster of impossible to control functions. Swiping and scrolling are difficult for people with arthritis. The reduced number of buttons from a standard controller looks intelligent until you realize there is no MUTE button, which is standard on all TV controllers. Anyone trying to mute a commercial on Apple TV realizes in an instant that Apple is not for TV. Even after trying to adjust for years, I finally starting to shop for a better streaming TV alternative. The only thing this does well is to play movies from iTunes or music from Apple. That makes it an expensive privilege to spend more money for Apple services.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2018","R. Sprague",190

"I Don't Get Hype","Where to begin. Well, the remote is just awful. So difficult to use and super sensitive. I had to find a YouTube video to assist me because there are very little instructions included. It took 5 minutes to plug everything in and over an hour and a half to setup accounts, etc. and it’s still not operational! It took 7 tries to connect to my Wi-Fi. I have a very reputable cable company and have had no problems connecting laptops, etc. I even called the cable’s customer service line to make sure the name and password for the Wi-fi were correct. It just kept saying it could not establish a connection. After that hurdle, the next was trying to connect my iPhone and link that account. Another fail, so I moved on to the manual setup. I tried entering my Apple id so I could start adding the essential apps needed to play back anything. You guessed it – could not locate my Apple id. I went to my PC and logged into iTunes and purchased one song just to verify the account was working. I gave up after several tried on the Apple TV. What a waste of money. At almost $200 (including the HDMI cables you need to purchase), boy was this disappointing. I can’t comment on the picture quality, because all I got to see were the menu pages. If you like getting frustrated easily, with absolutely no payoff, then this is the product for you. I’ll stick with my Amazon Firestick instead.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2018","Susan C.",191

"Difficult to use, signs you up for AppleTV without your knowledge.","The remote that comes with an AppleTV box is horrible. Within a week, I had to buy a user-friendly remote that works with AppleTV. Second, simply plugging in the box signs you up for a subscription to AppleTV+. You get a one-year free trial, but I thought I would start the trial when I was ready. A year later, Apple is trying to bill my credit card for AppleTV+. I didn’t sign up for that.Save yourself the headaches and get a Roku— far easier to use and no surprises.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2022","Rex Abert",196

"Too many Compromises","After 3 months of fighting with programming delays (endless sinning icons while trying to load something), blocky low resolution images, no screen saver updates and constant frustration with a poor user interface I finally ordered the Roku 4k and now I have easy, full HD and 4K images that look awesome. Apple makes great phones and computers, but the simple act of streaming video reliable and consistency seems a bridge too far.Note: I have 60mbps internet service and test it for speed and throughput often, I have an older HD Roku on the same network that is flawless. For 4k imaging the Apple just breakdown the image every single time.I am a huge Apple supporter, but just deal with the craziness any more!

FYI: IF you can identify the device you will be showing your video on and this device (TV or Monitor) has a USB port AND that this USB port support a thumb drive, then THIS is much easier to carry , start and stop.

"it's simple screen layout and remote design is far superior than the 4K","I had the first generation Apple TV and surprisingly, it's simple screen layout and remote design is far superior than the 4K. Why does Apple keeping trying to fix something that isn't broken? Don't you hate it when they keep trying and trying to outdo what they did before only to defeat themselves in the process. It take forever to load up the onscreen previews. There is supposed to be no buffering with the 4K -- it buffers all the time, and when I start watching something, it's totally blurry and the resolution won't get caught up until minutes later.

"Meh, for the price","This review is for Apple TV OS 11.2.1Overall I think this is a decent piece of hardware, but I am having a few software issues and support didn't follow through... thus the two stars.The problem is I'm having to restart the Apple TV after it sleeps for a while because streaming content like Sling & Amazon buffer and freeze. If I restart it, streams like a champ. I called their support, they had me try a bunch of basic junk, and ultimately escalated to a ""senior advisor"" who gave me a couple things to try (which didn't work). He said he'd e-mail me so we could be in contact and go back & forth... yeah he never e-mailed me.The touch remote is nice, depending on how the app implemented it.

"Constantly having to restart It!","The first few days were fine, unit worked well. Then one day, when I opened the Direct TV Now app, I found there was sound but no video. A black screen. I reinstalled the app thinking that was the issue. Same problem. Found out Amazon and Netflix had the same problem. Restarted ATV, video came back and everything was fine. But then, when the TV has been off for a long time, like when I go to bed, the next morning I always have to restart it to watch any app. I tried a reset. Same problem. Called Apple, they said it could be the HDMI cable. Suggested I get the $30 Belkin on their website, which I almost did. But I couldn’t see how this would make a difference because it’s not as if the picture quality is bad. The picture is perfect once you can get it going. I would think it’s a hardware or software issue. Software is up to date. I looked online and found that a lot of people have the same problem and can not find a solution. And for those who bought the Belkin cable, it did not solve the problem. I have a Sony Bravia XBR900E and I noted a lot of people had this problem with their Sony TVs. Aside from this problem, I like it. It’s easy to set up, and easy to navigate. The remote has a touch pad, and you can recharge it with a lightening cable. Also, Siri works fine. However, for the amount paid, one really shouldn’t have to put up with any problems.UPDATE I contacted Amazon for tech support. They said to return the item. I was surprised because it was after the return period, but returned it anyway. They’ve deducted a $35 restocking fee from my refund! Nobody said anything about a restocking fee. So warning to anyone who has the same problem as me.

Apple in general seems way overpriced and much to limited in all their latest generations of gadgets like Apple TVs and iPhones, just to name a few.

"Buyer beware!","I wanted so much to love Apple TV. I have all Apple products so I thought this would be a perfect addition. Nope. Set up was easy, but that was about it. We have subscriptions to Hulu, Netflix, amazon prime, and sling. For some reason Apple TV will always kick you over to iTunes first so you can ‘purchase’ the episodes. Uuuuumm no. So we have to go to the actual app first then find the show. From the home screen if you search it will never show you what’s in the apps you already have. Then to top it off the new remote is terrible... half the time the sensor track pad doesn’t work... you can sit there till you’re red in face swiping left, right, up, down, upside down, and even just yelling at it and nothing will happen. We’ve found that what works best is sitting on it accidentally. When you do that it works great! It will fast forward, rewind, and even open things you had no clue were on your Apple TV. So unless you’re hard core for you brand I recommend getting a roku or fire stick. Much less frustrating.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2018","Christina De La Torre",210

"Not worth the money","I bought this for a business trip. I own an iPad and an iPhone and I have used the screen mirroring capability in the past at my friend’s house because she owned an Apple TV. She loved it and I was sure I would love it, too. It can stream popular apps like Netflix and Hulu and you can display content from your iPad to the screen. Perfect, right? It does everything I need it to do.So, why the one star? I own a Roku and set up is easy and I never had any issues. I bought the Apple TV because I thought it would be a better product. Instead, I found the remote to be awkward. It’s thin and narrow and you need to actually read the instructions to see how it works. It was too touch sensitive which I am told can be adjusted. The set up takes a while as you select language and country with a remote that’s awkward to hold and use. And, for whatever reason, I keep holding the darn thing upside down. You can download an app if you prefer the ease of the phone. I found myself just using the Roku while at home because it’s so dang easy to use. Now here I am on business trip and I want to watch Netflix. I plug this device in and it doesn’t work with the WiFi in my room because it’s public. I figure maybe I can just stream/mirror from my iPad. Nope. I get an error message. I called in coworkers to assist. We google, we unplug, we restart, and at some point have the Apple TV “forget” my phone and iPad. That was a mistake because it needs WiFi and it won’t even recognize my phone. It is now a $180 paperweight. My coworkers give me a sad look because they have no problems streaming from their Roku device. I was the idiot who did not do enough research prior to purchasing.Long story short: Apple TV is an expensive piece of dog doo. Stupid thin and narrow remote. Set up takes too long. Doesn’t work in hotel room so don’t bring this on business trips. I am sure someone will tell me otherwise and I will concede to operator error. But my coworkers had no issues setting up their Roku in a hotel room. Roku is also cheaper and will give you everything you need except mirroring your iPad. Buy a separate adapter for that and it will probably still be cheaper.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2018","Wisp",211

"My One and Only Entertainment Hub","I have used Amazon's Fire TV and my Smart TV's built-in apps. Neither of those compares to the ease of use of the Apple TV 4K. I held off my purchase of an Apple TV until it had 4K ability, and now that it does, it's one of the best entertainment purchases I've made in a while. While anyone can use this, the maximum benefit is for those who are in Apple's ecosystem and have an Apple ID.— SETUP —Set up is easy: plug in HDMI cable from box to your TV; plug in power cord; you can choose a wireless setup, but I hardwired mine with an ethernet cable for a more secure and reliable streaming connection. Sign in with your Apple ID and begin getting apps.— APPS —You will likely find all the apps you need for the streaming services you subscribe to. There's Netflix, Amazon Video, Plex, Movies Anywhere, Vudu, HBO GO, Showtime Anytime, etc. Each of them has worked faster and smoother than the same apps available on my Smart TV, and it's one of the reasons I'd rather use the Apple TV 4K to access content vs using my TV.— ITUNES —I used to buy digital movies on Amazon. I immediately transitioned to iTunes once they offered 4K videos at the same cost as HD—and, free 4K upgrades to already purchased movies. This was the number one selling point for me. And with the Movies Anywhere app, a majority of my movies are synced between Amazon and iTunes (and other services).— HDR —This is Dolby Vision and HDR capable. Unfortunately, I bought my TV right before HDR became a thing, so I have no need for it. If you try to play HDR content on a non-HDR TV, you will notice visible gradient banding (my best description of it) on the image. Fortunately, there are options in the settings to play content in SDR instead of HDR. There are also many other video settings if you know what you're doing.— REMOTE —Firstly, buy a sleeve case for your remote, like the elago R1 Intelli Case Apple TV Remote . You don't want to pay sixty bucks to replace it if you break the glass surface. The remote is amazing to use. It's responsive, it's simple to learn, and it can do voice search. If you have to type anything, you can link it to your phone and type from your phone as well.— SUMMARY —I've had this for eight months and I love using it. Yes, there is a premium cost over competitors but Apple TV 4K is so worth it (to me) for the design, usability, and convenience. Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2018","benjamin bannister",211
"Amazing! Especially if you are in the Apple Ecosystem","I had the last model of the Apple TV before the 4k model and I didn't really use it that much because it wasn't that useful. I ended up just using my TV apps for most of my viewing but I go the 4k model free with a Direct TV NOW promotion. Boy, is THIS model SOOOOO much more useful than the last one. The main thing I love about this is the TV app, you can select shows that you like to watch and they will all show up in one interface and when a new show comes out for a selected show it will be shown here, so it makes it really convenient for catching up on shows. I also like that you can browse through moves and then set them to show up in the TV app so you can come back later when you are ready to watch them.I was worried about the remote, but I've now grown to love it. Yes, if you were forced to use the touch pad remote to always scroll through your content, it would suck, but you can simply tap on the touch pad to do single movements on the device that feels a lot more like traditional remote. Also, you can always program almost any other standard remote to work with your Apple TV if you prefer the feel of a more traditional remote.Siri also works SO well for finding shows, movies, turning on captions or rewinding 30 seconds or 1 minute easily to catch something you missed in your show. If you have Apple Music and your TV is set up to a stereo system, you can also use the Apple TV as really great music player and play music just by talking to Siri, which is really great.All in all, I think the Apple TV is the best streaming box especially if you are already in the Apple Ecosystem. You can control the TV with your iPhone or Apple Watch, steam content from your Mac or iPhone which is all really really great. For me, I now only use the Apple TV as my main streaming device, it is fast and responsive and has a great interface. It also makes it really easy to cut the cable cord and save so much money by simply streaming all your content and maybe using a service like Direct TV now, Playstation Vue or Sling for your live TV needs.I for sure would not hesitate to get this. It is worth the price but you might even be able to get it for Free if you pay for 3 months of Direct TV Now if they are still offering that promotion!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2018","Joseph D.

"I hate Apple but...","I hate Apple, can't stand their ""walled garden"" but I have to say I love the Apple TV 4K. It solved, along with an app called Infuse Pro 5, a problem with streaming content from my Synology NAS to my new 4K TVs. I had a 7 year old Samsung and 4 year old Samsung TVs, both could stream anything directly (1080P), no issues with sound or video. But now, with two new 4K TVs (One Vizio the other Samsung) I was having trouble stream the same content from my NAS, and couldn't stream 4K to my Vizio at all (Unsupported this or that errors). I did a lot of searching to try to find a solution to the problem. I tried my Roku Ultra with the Synology DS Video app, it failed. I tried casting from my phone, failed. It was looking like I needed a new NAS, at $1500, to transcode the video/audio to work with my TVs. Then, like mana from heaven, I found the answer... an Apple TV and Infuse Pro 5. It works so well, I love the device, I can now browse my NAS and stream 4K, or any of my old content. The Apple TV's menu is intuitive and it was easy to setup. For those haters of the remote... I love it too. The remote is natural, the touch pad works great, as does the voice. In the end I may still hate Apple but this Apple TV 4K is the best streamer out there!

There are menus within menus, plus there’s a menu across the top that if you “miss select” you’re in trouble because when you try to nudge it slightly left or right it suddenly jumps out of the AppleTV home-screen to some other streaming product...I dare you to get back to where you were ‘cause they’s going to be five successive places you don’t want to go.I get up to get something from the fridge. Don’t touch it! I shout: I’ve got my eye on it! I sit down calmly and the little suckers gone. It’s completely disappeared in the flick of an eye. I think it’s joined the sock from the dryer.My housemates lost hers, her teenagers’ lost hers, so that side of the house is trying to do work arounds & I’ve tried three times to get the AppleTV app on my IPhone to work. One’s ability to do that is covered in another’s review here.Let’s just say from the time this product was introduced, & all of the reviews that have been written, Apple executives haven’t changed anything. Redesign it? Hell no, Apple only has billions in cash. Apple only has billions in cash. Which leads me to believe the executives and designers don’t use their own product. I wonder what billionaires do use?With glee in my voice I say: Netflix anyone ?","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2020","WesternCOriver",212
"The Bees Knees.","Just got this today from the ATT store with a special running with Directv Now Streaming Service. Was free with 3 months prepaid service (ended up being about 105 dollars due to paying 3 months streaming service and the box is yours to keep even if you cancel.I gotta say, this beats the heck outta the firestick I just bought last week which won’t even play Vudu movies.Was able to put the Directv Now app along with my Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu and Vudu. Is fast and has worked great.

"Worstless device","Although we didn’t purchase on Amazon, I feel it’s my duty to write this review. Worst $199 ever spent. Worst product support, they don’t know anything about their own product. We have had non-stop problems. First, the picture randomly blacks out and blinks. We can hear the sound, but no picture. Sometimes it just blinks with a red line at the top and bottom. Next, we have a premium sound system so what happens? Our only option is tv speakers. We’re Apple fans and have many Apple products, but this device is worst less. I would NEVER spend money on this again. It’s still under warranty and they want us to send it back, wait for them to “fix it” and then send it back. Until then, what???

"Hot Mess of Bad UI and Outdated Technology","It's like Apple designers and technologists didn't have time to do anything on this device so they relegated all the work to Stanford freshmen interns. Here's a list of the sins they have succumbed to:- Bluetooth rarely works. Good luck pairing any device not sanctioned by Apple. Won't work! Restarting Apple TV, bluetooth headphone, etc. will result in just more clicks on the remote.- Amazingly bad voice recognition. It's like the ML team gave up at the most popular 100 utterances. Ask for something foreign, good luck! Ask for something produced that's over 5 years old - not recognizable. Just sad!- User interface sluggish. It's like you have to have the controller 5cm next to the device or there's an amazingly bad lag and you end up on the 10th click that you entered.Apple, you've really dropped the ball on TV technology. Maybe hire some non-interns to work on this device.Please!","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2020","Robert R.",212
"Useless Remote","I bought this because my Samsung Q70 TV does not offer an option to disable HDR, this device does, so that issue was fixed. I am not very satisfied with my purchase though, let's begin with the remote. I do not know what kind of evil person would design something so unintuitive and delicate as this. The bottom half is glass, so if you drop it, you can kiss it good bye, the top half is a touch pad because, well, you know... everyone needs touch pads in their remotes? Good luck trying to scroll through your netflix menu without accidentally rushing through 17 shows due to the fact that the touch pad is quite sensible. Not only that, the freaking buttons are right on the middle of the remote, so half of the time you will grab it upside down! Seriously? Moving on to the apple tv itself, it is an all right device, offers plenty of options with one major flaw, if you use hulu get ready for some frustration. Apple and Hulu are not friends, you can tell by how ridiculously buggy the Hulu app is, you will have to restart your apple tv device every now and then because Hulu won't open and will crash your device. Considering how expensive this ""premium"" streamer is, I am extremely disappointed.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2020","Aloxxo",212
"Think Twice - Better yet, Wait for the next generation","I've been an Apple TV user going back the the first generation and have upgraded with each new generation. My current Apple TV 4K 64GB unit supports a Dolby Vision/Atmos home theater system with 11 active channels. When it works properly, the UHD/Vision video resolution and uncompressed Atmos sound is unsurpassed. However, so far I'm disappointed in the quality of current model and hesitate recommending it.This is in fact my second unit. The first went defective after 11 months, just inside the warranty period - thank god. That unit mysteriously began locking up my network with what looked like a DOS attack. After a lot of component tracing and sleuthing, I finally proved to Apple that the LAN chip must have a bug. Thankfully they replaced the unit. The second unit also seems to display mysterious behavior. Periodically, streaming apps will lock up requiring me to reboot the unit. On occasion, it locks up so badly I've had to do a physical reboot by disconnecting the power.If I'm the only person with issues on two units - all I can say is I wish I had this kind of luck at winning the Lottery!Quality and bugginess notwithstanding, the new Bluetooth controller is the ABSOLUTE WORSE piece of electronics Apple has ever produced. Don't take my word for it, go to various enthusiast websites and do your own research. First, when picking up the controller in a dark room, there's no tactile way to know which side is top or bottom. As result you frequently end up doing something you didn't intend. The unit has a touch/click pad on the top that can be under sensitive, or oversensitive without rhyme or reason. It is used both to execute commands (press) as well as move forward/backward (slide finger or press the edges). Good luck with that. You simply have no idea what's actually going to happen when you use the controller.Overall, this is the most frustrating controller I've ever used, bar none. How frustrating you wonder? How about smash it against the wall and shatter it to pieces, anger management territory, frustrating?Rumour has it Apple plans to replace the controller with their next iteration of the Apple TV. Meanwhile, you can use the controller app on your phone or you can use an older controller from the previous gen Apple TV. Trust me either is a better option.My recommendation is wait for the next generation Apple TV with a new controller or try a different brand streaming device. Maybe by then they will have worked out the bugs.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2021","Vic of New York",212

"With the Apple Remote 2 stars, with a universal remote, 5 stars!","I am a long time Apple user, with a lot of devices and Mac computers. But it has taken me a while to jump on the cord cutting bandwagon because of live sports and the great DVRs from Dish and DirecTV. When I brought this home and signed up for the DTV Now streaming service, I couldn’t have been more disappointed. Using the Apple remote to scroll the channel guide was excruciating. It’s like nobody at Apple over the age of 30 used this remote. What a flipping pathetic design. I’m speechless that Apple could screw up a human interface so badly. I don’t want to talk to my remote, I guarantee my thumb is faster... on a half decent remote anyway. So I was ecstatic to find out that I could at least program the ATV to work with a universal remote. $10 for a GE universal remote from amazon and I’m now a happy camper. I can actually scroll the DTV Now channel guide straight up and down without veering off to the left or right. Seriously, Apple, ditch the POS remote design. (The Roku remote is a good place to start, but still not as nice of a user experience as the $10 GE. Seriously Roku - the volume is on the side? Oh that’s right you’re the only one to have ever figured out it works better there. Not!!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2018","Campin' Cowpoke",213
"Dolby vision/atmos but at too high price?","We started out w amazon FireStick, then FireStick 4k, pretty happy with them, especially the price. So got the apple for our 1st born & a 2nd mortgage. research carefully, you can find charts around online on which streaming service has Dolby vision/atmos with what streaming device. Amazon only offers a few vision/atmos programs. Apple checks off all the boxes. We had jus bought a new lg 4k tv so I wanted everything I could get in Dolby vision/hdr...typical apple product: slick, refined, higher end feel, high quality, responsive, fairly easy to navigate menu. Vision/hdr/atmos works as it should with mixed impressions. I haven’t seen any examples of Dolby vision that made me drop my beer in awe yet. Weather thru streaming or disc. So I’m now not sure if it was worth the price, Basing the purchase almost solely on that. We have numerous apple products throughout the house, and everything works well together. So, expensive, but ok I like it. However..the remote has a special place in hell. It’s terrible. It’s soooo sensitive you constantly skip over the app you want. Ff & reverse is touchy. Adjusting speeds does little. The remote is too small as well. My wife hates the ps4 remote, but I gotta say even though it’s kinda clumsy, it’s better than the apples remote. By contrast the far cheaper amazon remote is damn near perfect. Typical apple over designing things and reinventing the wheel. I bet if they released an amazon remote knock off, they’d sell like hot cakes. So..in closing if you have the xtra dough & need the latest hdr and sound, then it’s great. If this is you’re 1st streaming device, I’d start with the amazon. If amazon could get more Dolby licensing, it’d be a no brainer.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2019","me1313",213

I had the AppleTV until I got a FireTV , I now have FireTV on every TV in the house. Having a FireTV box opens up HBO quality programming made just for FireTv. You must have a prime account when you buy the fireTV, With the prime account you get all kinds of steaming music, and HBO quality programing. There is so much of it, it is a no brainer to get FireTV. You might be in love with Apple, but Apple is all about the money, they have some free stuff, but nothing that compares to what Amazon produces for FireTV. The interface on firetV is fantastic.

"Bought as a cheap Zwift player","I bought this as a cheap Zwift player, which it does ok, not nearly as good as a PC, but you can't expect it to be on par with a full blown PC for an application like this. It does the job admirably for Zwift usage in my opinion. The big issues with the apple TV when you're working out is the absolute horrible, horrible remote control. The remote control is a touch sensor similar to what you would have on a laptop, where you slide your finger to move the cursor. The problem when you're working out, is that you're all sweaty and that doesn't work well in practice.As a media player, the UI is not as intuitive as a Fire TV or Roku player. Apple TV makes no effort to try and make things easy for you like entering an email address or login. The virtual keyboard layout is absolutely miserable compared to other media players, and takes a lot more effort to type with the remote than other systems. If you want to change your wi-fi password, again, it's not super intuitive with Apple TV compared to other systems, there is no ""Forget"" option and it continually just tries to connect with the old credentials.I'll stick with it because it does Zwift Ok, but definitely not something I would use as a media player on each of the TV's in my house.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2021","Paul A.

"Worst Purchase Ever - Don't Do It!","I bought this Apple TV when it first came out and it has been a horrible experience from day 1. It was connecting to the internet before and I took it into the ""Genius"" bar 4 different times before they admitted there could be an issue.And now just a few days before the 1 year warranty expires, the remote went out. Isn't it a bit odd that it stopped working after a software update and also just a few days after the warranty expires?I also didn't even use it that much because I was so disgusted with it and Apple's customer service. I use my Roku a lot more because it's so much more reliable and it was available when I had to send in my Apple TV for repair. So I had this thing for almost 2 months before it actually started working.I called about getting the remote fixed and of course they couldn't, but I could buy a new one for $60!!!!!! $60 for a remote????? And then on top of it, they said I had to send in the old one so they could examine it and if I didn't, they would charge me $10. WHAT? So if you buy the remote through customer service, they charge you $10 if you don't send in the old one. If you just buy the remote online, they don't charge you the $10 to return the old remote.I can't believe this is where we are with Apple. They really are losing site of their customer and how to handle repairs. Just so disappointed.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2018","Desert Rose",213
"Not for children","We bought an Apple 4k TV with our Spectrum service, and it seems to work well enough, once you figure out what's going on. The Spectrum app has some non-intuitive interfaces as pertains to DVR functionality, to the point that I wasn't sure there was any, but I don't think I should blame Apple for that.However, the normal Apple complaints abound. If you want to use your Apple ID, perhaps because you have music on iTunes, you need to authenticate it from an Apple device. You can't two-factor to a non-Apple phone or computer, so you're stuck not using paid for Apple content if you don't remember your login.Additionally, Apple has chosen to go for form over function. The touch surface takes a bit of getting used to, and you can't seem to go to a specific channel. Instead, the Siri commands only work on the broader Apple interface, not inside the apps. Additionally, the remote has a glass bottom, the same glass that appeared on the iPhone 4. If you remember that phone, it's because the glass fractured at the drop of a hat; I owned an Apple TV for less than two days before my toddler managed to fracture mine, when I hadn't had any issues with a Google Fi, Xbox, or Vizio remote.So you get all the flash that fanboys expect of an Apple product, but it appears to lack the engineering that once made Apple products must haves.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2020","Peter Hillegas",213
"4k screensavers almost worth the cost","Pricey and whomever gave green light for remote should be fired. I will leave the remote alone for now. The interface of this device is gorgeous and simple to use. Setup a breeze. It is my main goto streaming device although I have Roku 4k and Amazon 4k firestick. I also love that when you purchase movies from ITUNES they upscale them to 4k for free. The 4k is beautiful and as I mentioned the screen saver pictures I can watch those for an hour because the resolution is spectacular. I use it to watch my NHL package, NFL Gamepass, and MLBTV package. Hbo, Showtime Netflix Hulu, Starz all streamed through this powerful device. I bought the mount and clamp to mount it to the top of my LG 55”4k tv because I wanted a clear line for the remote. I would like to take 3 stars off just for the remote. It is like a toy you would find in a Cracker Jack box. It has a small mouse pad you have to navigate with your big fat thumb. And if you want to fast forward through a commercial at only 10 second increments you have to be so dexterous to push the top right corner of the remote consecutively about 15x in a row, if you fail once and press the mousepad while pressing the top right corner your life becomes almost worth not living anymore. The marker on timeline freezes and you can then decide to press mouse pad and risk moving ahead 15 minutes and I have jumped too far ahead where I saw the outcome of the sporting event I was watching. Maybe it’s small because at this point I wanted to throw the remote through the tv but it’s so small it may not even crack the screen of the tv. It has no lights so if you watch tv in the dark like 99.99% of human beings, you cannot tell which end is up, the bottom half looks just like the mouse pad on top half, you can also easily press the Siri microphone option is you try to hit the menu button, now you have siri’s Attention and she waits for a command but she doesn’t know you accidentally pressed the microphone, so to make Siri go away you have to press the microphone again which since it’s dark you can’t see where that button is, it’s kind of like reading Braille, you have to just feel around for the menu button. You should have a flashlight handy if you are going to use this POS remote. I guarantee Steve Jobs would not have allowed this remote to ever be made or released to the public, but the streaming box is a work of art. 64GB is a ton of memory, if you have the money and want the most powerful streaming device available then buy this. But you can own two 4k Roku and a 4k Amazon firestick and still have $50 to use towards a dinner out on the town. The Screen Savers are conversation starters if you have guests over. And Apple did finally decide to let you know what you are looking at, just gently tap the mouse pad and it will let you know where on earth these beautiful shots are from, and they aren’t still shots, they are panning as if a slow drone is filming them, some are from the space station which really makes things real, wen you can look at our planet from space in 4k, awesome. I guarantee Neil Armstrong would have one of these devices just for this option. Most people would suffice with 32GB memory but I treated myself to the 64 as I was planning in tv to evolve and I might need that memory one day. Like i said, if price point isn’t a huge deal then buy this now. If you get angry easily don’t because the remote will make you want to smash a hole in the wall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2019","Pharmtech",213
"Drops Ethernet and BT audio","I have apple TV's of second and third generation. Was looking forward to this one but sorely disappointed.Not all is bad. I like using the voice input option to set it up with login email address and password however my husband's voice input isn't always recognized, mine is. However it is easy to confuse and press the voice button instead of the menu button. They are both circluar and on the left side and that's annoying as they do two different things. We have gotten used to the touch bar area but that has taken time. I don't see any advantage to it really. Maybe it was cheaper to make than putting in FF and Rev buttons? We may be getting used to it but neither of us like using it over a button. It requires finger pressure continuously or intermittently in a specific area depending on what you want it to do.The worst thing about it is the need to constantly restart it and that is buried deeply in the settings menu. Why? Because the Ethernet connection is unstable and it constantly reverts to WiFi then has to choose between the 5G wifi signal or the lower one. With every change between WiFi SSID strengths the password has to be reentered and to get it back to Ethernet, it need to be restarted. It won't change over from the settings menu. Its a royal pain to have to reconnect it to the internet every time we use it so we disconnected the Ethernet cable and removed the 5G wireless SSID signal so that only one SSID is broadcasted. That seems to have fixed the problem with apple TV requiring us to enter a WiFi password each time we use an app.Unlike a computer where you can switch users, on Apple TV different household members have to log in on the apps. It means you are constantly logging in and out to to be able to use your playlists and pick up from where you last watched a program. Not only that, but even after setting up and logging in, it's not uncommon to have to resestablish the right to use them by requesting a code be entered after logging into a browser on another device.Another major problem is the Audio has to go through the HDMI or BT. The idiot who designed the BT soundbar connection put that under BT devices (not the audio settings) and it was a nightmare to find (no manual) but either way it's buried and a pain to get to each time you turn on the Apple TV. It remains paired but as soon as the TV input is changed or the TV is turned off the Apple TV defaults to audio over HDMI. If your TV sound is as bad as ours and goes through a soundbar instead you are stuck with using a BT connection that is dropped. To save money, on this version, they dropped the external optical sound output for a cable.Apps are not refreshed and the only way to refresh some, like Fubo, is to dig into settings, restart the Apple TV and then go back into setting, find BT devices and reconnect the BT sound bar. On this version the apps are locked so that an iPad or computer is required to reconnect their function. Much like an iPhone or iPad, each app has its own log in.There are days when I decide it's a pleasanter experience to stream over the third generation Apple TV from my phone or iPad or just watch from my iPad. I was deathly sick for 3 weeks after buying Apple TV so the return period was up by the time I was able to get it set up, sorted out and identify the problems. It does work and everything I have mentioned is ""expected behaviour"". I would certainly have returned it and continued happily using my lesser generation Apple TVs despite the fact that they do not support the newer apps like SmugMug and Fubu. It is also hard to figure out how to install apps and move them and delete them. There is no manual so I had to search You Tube and tutorials to figure it out.I was hoping the last update (Feb 2020) would correct the behavior of not keeping the BT sound bar connection as my preferred audio default or the Ethernet cable as my preferred connection type but no such luck. I have given apple feedback on these issues.There are a couple of improvements. It is much easier to move the apps around the screen and after hitting the restart command it takes only a few seconds (we have a FiOS connection).","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2020","SandiMacD",213
"Steve Jobs is rolling in his grave","We got one of the early Apple TV's because the entire universe of TV interface is abysmal - maybe worse than that. The remote with 50 buttons you never use but a four way joystick to choose letters - it's truly one of the levels of hell that this still exists.Somehow Apple, the company that popularized the mouse, gave us icons and the desktop and a touch screen thinks that sliding your finger on a touch pad to select letters from a board - like we're paralyzed patients trying to find a way to input our wishes one painful letter at a time. It is truly the greatest technological failure of our time and Apple decides to upgrade that with a touch pad. Bravo!Siri is a slight benefit but only for avoiding the typing. She is just as useless as ever if you try to find something. Asked to find ""The Office"" she'll bring up a random show with no way to navigate to the collection of shows. It's maddening how awful and unintuitive the interface actually is. I really thought it would be better but it's worse.To understand how much worse it is my kids will search the couch cushions to find the old Apple TV remote because it's easier to use.Lastly, and because it deserves to be mentioned so hopefully some at Apple burns at the stake, is the painful process of putting in passwords for every app. If you use a password manager you have super complicated passwords that have punctuation, upper and lower case, numbers and symbols - now do that for 20-30 characters with a touchpad and each character is obscured after you type it. This is the final level of hell and where I hope every single Apple engineer spends eternity for their sins of interface.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2020","Gregor H",213
"Can’t recommend due to the remote","I would give this system 5 stars bc it’s pretty smart and I like the general layout. I love how when I grab the remote, a remote will pop up on my phone so I can use it to type in shows. That’s pretty cool.BUT, and this is a biG BUT, the trackpad remote is the WORST THING that has even been invented. Who thought it was a good idea to give a remote a trackpad that 1. is way more sensitive than my iphone so it never goes where you want it to and 2. will change channels every time it’s grabbed? I bought the Apple TV for our bedroom and every time one of us barely touches the remote (moving positions in bed will even do it!) it changes the channel or pauses what we are watching. A remote should be touch only but you have to look at how you grab this one or it’ll mess up. And considering it’s the size of an old iPod it’s easy to accidentally touch the trackpad and change channels. We did buy a rubber case for it and it’s helped but not enough. I wont be buying another Apple TV until they fix this remote issue.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2019","ally_trout",214
"Great Product Missing Some Important Features","Of all the streaming boxes I prefer Apple tv to all the rest but it comes with some serious limitations. The interface is the cleanest of the bunch and once you get familiar with the remote it's fairly easy to use, you can also easily use your phone.It's very expensive compared to its peers and probably not worth it in most circumstances. I received mine through a promo, otherwise, I would not have paid full price for it. The Ap store is severely limited compared to Amazon and Google. How is it possible there is not One VPN application in Apple's store, although it exists on iPhone and Ipad. You can still get a VPN set up on it but it's a project. Amazon and Google offer easy to use Aps from the top 10 sites. This is one example of Apple's limitations with the Ap Store, but there are many others.The remote alone is $50+ to replace which is more than a complete set up from Amazon or Roku. They need to get a bit more competitive with price and compete with applications to be worthy of anything above 3 stars.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2020","KurtChicago",214
"Best Streamer but Will Cost You More","This is in my opinion the best streaming box of any that I have used. My experience includes owning and using Roku, Fire TV, and Chromecast as a comparison. The greatness starts with the outstanding flexibility of voice searches with Siri. There is a lot you can do with the voice search that you cannot do with any other device. As an example, I can ask for movies or shows specific to a service like, ""horror movies on Netflix"" and it will show content just on Netflix. If I have a TV subscription with sports services I can say, ""watch the Chicago Bulls"" and if there is a live game on an app I have installed the Apple TV will automatically go to that app and start playing the Bulls game. It is these kind of features that elevate the Apple TV experience beyond the normal TV experience.The Apple TV app is also a great source for finding ""free"" content on the apps you have installed. You will find integrations with apps like Hulu, Prime Video, Tubi TV, and a host of TV everywhere apps. The biggest miss here is Netflix, but the voice search makes up for this. The TV app is also the source I go to for Live sports with my Hulu Live TV subscription I have access to apps like ESPN, NBC Sports, and Fox sports. The games on these channels integrate with the TV app so you can see what live sporting events are on. You also get notifications when games are starting for your favorite teams and updates on when games are close. These notification show up in the upper right hand corner of the screen and keep you informed on what is going on with your favorite sports teams. It is another feature not found on any other streaming devices.There is more here that I could talk about and if you just use the Apple TV as a normal streaming box you will be missing out on some pretty awesome features. I could probably write a small book of the little things I have learned how to do with the Apple TV. If you want the premium experience, I think this little box is worth the money, whether it is the 4K version or the older 1080P one, both are the best streamers available right now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2018","Raymond R.

"Apple User Who is Going Back to Roku","I have had every generation of the Apple TV except the first. The 4K Apple TV is the only one I had any issues with. It is already the most expensive 4K streamer on the market by a hefty margin. To top it off Apple HDR only supports Dolby 4K. So on top being nearly $200, you now need a $40 HDMI cable made by Belkin. Not that I think the cable is overly expensive, but my son's 4k Roku Premiere works just fine with a $10 HDMI2.0 cable found here on Amazon. 4K Youtube is not supported. The remote kept losing connection forcing me to reset several times until I finally restored it through iTunes. A day went by and it started happening again.Long story short, this is the first Apple product I have had to return in a long line of Apple Products purchased for my household. The Roku Premiere is just a better streaming box for less than half the price. Going to miss having an Apple TV and using my HomePods as a really nice sound bar replacement. 4K is here to stay now that I finally upgraded and its back to Roku.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2019","Brian K.",214
"One of the most frustrating pieces of electronics I’ve ever used","I had used an older Apple TV 4 years ago and had really enjoyed the interface, it was intuitive and navigation was easy. The 4K model is a nightmare. I thought the track pad would be a no-brainer but it is probably responsible for most of the frustration of using this device. I was expecting the trackpad to be as accurate as the screen on an iPhone but it is so unresponsive it’s a miracle I haven’t snapped the remote in two in frustration. To use the trackpad to navigate during a show feels like it registers inputs 50/50 at best- either there is no response or the response is not what you want and you end up doing something like rewinding or exiting a show you're watching.. The controls/gestures are also not intuitive and once you think you have it figured out the trackpad either doesn’t respond or you get sent back in a loop. Maybe it’s me but swiping left and right sometimes gets recognized as up and down and up and down sometimes does not even get recognized. The design of the remote is especially frustrating, it’s so small and slippery that it gets lost, misplaced or camouflaged anywhere and the trackpad actually ends up being too sensitive at the wrong times so when you sit on it or brush against it you end up changing programs, fast forwarding etc because it doesn’t need to be pointed at the Apple TV box to work. The remote is also symmetrical in that when you grab it you can’t tell which side is up and you will hit the wrong button and instead of searching you are now being sent outside the app to the main menu. There’s no fast forward or rewind buttons. It’s up to you to thumb wrestle with the trackpad to find how far forward, backwards or in my case out of the show you want.The main menu interface is fine. All the apps are in a row like apps are. The interface issues are in app and in knowing if you need to press the trackpad, swipe up, swipe down or throw it across the room. There is a Menu button as well as a TV shaped button. If you can tell me which button means Back, Return, Menu, Power and Exit then maybe the Apple TV is for you.If you want a streaming device just get a Roku. It’s cheaper, more intuitive and will do everything you want.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2019","DA",214

"Remote too sensitive","The remote and selection coloring is unimaginably un user friendly. So disappointed. We love being able to download apps and will suffer through for that advantage (we upgraded from a first generation), but fast forwarding on the remote is misery. I gave it six months before writing this review hoping we just needed time to adjust but we are still struggling greatly. You simply do NOT have god control over how fast and how far. The remote is way too sensitive. Also, the size and coloring of which item is being selected often doesn’t differ enough from the other options to allow for seeing what is selected, for example, when turning on/off captions.Summary: We love adding apps and the voice feature, but the remote is so horrific that we choose to use our archaic smart tv instead of our Apple TV as often as possible.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2021","Dawn H.",214
"Continuous crashes of both of the the devices and applications after being up upgraded to iPad os14.","Since Apple updated the tv 4K to ipad os14 the device has become worthless. Starting it almost always causes the device to continually reboot, when it does start up most of the apps simply crash instantly. YouTube crashes as soon as as it starts, nothing plays, nothing works at all. In addition, the remote does nothing at all, worthless. I paired a Bluetooth keyboard with it and can use some apps for a while until they fail. Have tried reloading the apps that fail but now cannot start the AppStore app at all. Purchased a new remote control which lasted less that an hour, exchanged that remote for a replacement which failed as soon as it was paired.All in all, the Apple TV No longer works, it has somehow become damaged when it auto updated to the iPad os14, once the update completed and the iPad rebooted it does not seem possible to run any selected app, just click and crash.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2020","Al F.

"Finally, everything in one place!","I have 3 Rokus in my home and a Firestick. Both are fine devices. The Firestick was a gift but when I added the Spectrum streaming app to my arsenal of streaming apps I was very disappointed to find that it doesn't run on Firestick. So I turned back to a Roku which does support Spectrum. But I still yearned to be able to integrate my iTune content and what is a girl to do then? You have to have a Apple TV if you truly want everything available immediately on the same device.I don't own a 4K TV yet but I will. I'm in no rush. For now I purchased it for the massive storage and for the fact that I can and will upgrade one day.Yes the remote is annoying. It's my first Apple TV even though I own many, many apple toys. Imagine my surprise after looking like an idiot, staring at it puzzled, trying to go through set up without knowing the touch area even existed. Typing is a pain; either you fly through the selection too fast or it requires a more heavy handed touch. I honestly wish that it just had a toggle button. I'm also not as crazy about the Spectrum interface on Apple as I was on Roku. It's not as easy to find what you need, hoping there is just a learning curve.But I love it. I've only had it for a day but I've declared quite a few times so far that I love this thing. Even without 4K the playback is lovely and it is indeed super fast. Love that it automatically controls your TV without the hassle of set up.Siri apparently cannot recognise everything. For instance, the OWN channel is mistaken for ""I"" !?!

"Any problems, call Apple first.","We bought a number of Apple TVs starting with an Amazon Wharehouse ""acceptable"" model which has been the most used item. We also bought an Apple 4k from the Wharehouse which was perfect, but we decided to upgrade to the latest model. Once we received the latest model, we had a number of difficulties which in retrospect were not due to device but to other factors including 1. defective internet 2. support which did not investigate the problem thoroughly and a preprogramed TV which interfered with the transition from HBO, Showtime to the Spectrum App. So to all of you who might be experiencing buffering or difficulty transitioning, make sure your first call is to Apple and ask for an Apple TV specialist. Should you not be sure if this is the device for you, I would highly recommend looking at Wharehouse models. Everyone we bought worked perfectly and didn't have some of the problems we encountered with the more advanced models. We also used a sound bar and that is less necessary than before because the audio is so sharp and clear. After all the calls t o Apple, always professional and happy to help and four visits by the cable company, we are now happily enjoying our Apple TV. I hope all of our travails make the experience easier for everyone else.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2019","Em M.",214
"Does everything I need -- finally","I have owned numerous different generations of Apple TVs and this one is far and away the best yet. Unfortunately, Apple is determined to not let you download your movie content for viewing in a place where you have no WiFi, so this is a streaming device only. That is the only criticism I have of this device. Otherwise it has corrected most of my criticisms of earlier versions of the Apple TV.One major improvement over my old Apple TV models is that this Apple TV allows me to access my Amazon Video content. This is huge, as about half of my movie and TV collection is on Amazon, and half on iTunes. Thus, this device gives me single unit with which to access all of my TV and movie content. This is a big deal to me. This alone justifies the somewhat stiff price for this Apple TV.The other improvement here is the remote. It takes a little getting used to, but I like it. One really great feature of the remote is that it can instantly learn how to be a volume control for your TV setup. So the Apple TV remote does almost everything I need a remote to do. Another big improvement that sounds small but in practice is a very nice amenity.Setup is Apple-simple. Mostly I just sat my iPhone next to the Apple TV and setup was automatic. The only manual setup I had to do was to enter my Amazon password in order to access my Amazon content.I am not really sure what the 64GB gets you with this device since it will not allow you to download content for non-connected viewing. I went with 64GB just to ""future proof"" it -- someday there will be something that needs or benefits from the extra memory, I imagine.I don't have 4K TV yet but someday ...Overall this unit gives an excellent experience and can serve as the hub of one's entertainment system--especially for people like me who use both iTunes and Amazon as content providers.

"Crappy remote - Do not buy this!","I usually love apple products. I bought this one to easily display my photos on my tv. I hate 3 things about the remote. 1. It is very fragile. The glass it is made of breaks when it call off the arm rest. 2. The touch interface is difficult to use. It is not easy to move to a selection without overshooting or drifting off the item you wish to select. Better would be selection arrow like a Roku remote has. 3. No mute button on the remote. Roku has this also. The one advantage this product has is that it is multitasking meaning you can switch from Hulu to Neflix and return exactly to where you left off on Hulu. If you feel you want to buy this make sure you get a remote cover/protector. That something I never even thought of having to buy. Apple I am very disappointed in this remote design and if you are committed to this silly design at least include a remote cover so your customers don't end up forking out another $60 for a replacement.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2020","T.

"Not bad but could use some tweaks and expensive","I'm brand new to Apple TV... surely Apple is ""intuitive"" and ""easy to use"", right? Well that's what everyone says but I was stumped at setup trying to select something after using swiping gestures. It took me awhile to figure out you can press/click the swiping area. Someone new to Apple TV would have no idea because Apple just shows you (on screen) how to swipe and never says or shows to click the swiping area to select. Plus, you use the ""MENU"" button on the remote to go back. Very unintuitive for someone who's never used such a remote before especially because Apple never tells you this while you're setting it up... maybe they think you already know these ""basics"" even if you've never owned an Apple TV before.Anyway, after some trouble trying to learn how to use the Apple TV due to poor documentation and not being very intuitive, I do think I'm going to like it. I recently bought some UHD movies in Dolby Vision that were on sale for about 5 bucks (supposedly one of the good things about Apple TV is that Apple (often?) runs discounts/sales on good 4K movies) and look forward to watching the first Dolby Vision movie I've ever watched on my 65"" OLED TV. Reviews say the quality should be excellent.On another note, the unit seems quite powerful and capable... so I hope it lasts for years. One thing Apple is good at is supporting their devices. The iPhone 5S is still getting updates.UPDATE 2018-12-06: Bought some 4K movies on iTunes and have been disappointed with the ""4K"" quality... and the movie with Atmos sound kept crapping out (with a Denon 4300 receiver) so I had to turn Atmos off... so minus another star.So 3 stars for now... minus 2 for the negatives I mentioned above and for being relatively expensive.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2018","Lantana Al",215

First off, the touch sensor on the remote is SO difficult to use, and if you so much as breathe on it, it will exit out of the app you are using. Also, it is made of GLASS, so if you drop it on a hard surface, it will shatter. So you mean to tell me that a bunch of engineers sat around a table and said “I have a great idea! Let’s make one of the most commonly dropped things in the world out of glass.” I don’t know who designed this ridiculous remote, but they should be fired!The device has CONSTANT connectivity issues with Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, and DirecTV Now.

"Didn't watch regular TV for a month after I got this","The Apple TV is the best way to watch Amazon Prime content I have found. Its UI is fast and attractive to use. It loads Amazon content in a second, and play it at very high HD quality. I was using a Tivo before to watch Amazon, and the Apple TV is (literally) ten to twenty times faster than Tivo. Apple TV's Amazon Prime content looks like lightly compressed 1080p content, while Tivo's Amazon Prime content looks like upscaled 480p content.Btw, the 32GB version is more than enough storage for most users. The additional storage is not useful for TV watching, it's for people who want to download a lot of very large games or hundreds of apps.The Apple TV can do more than watch Amazon videos. You can install third party apps built just for it, though Apple has said that it would eventually like the Apple TV and iOS devices to share apps. You can ask Siri for a bunch of stuff like the weather, though not as much as you can ask for on a phone. The YouTube app is simple but fast and works well too.The Apple TV also serves as a Homekit hub. There's a one to two second delay with a typical setup of a motion detector turning on a light. The UI for Homekit on iOS is unfinished and harder to use than usual Apple products. There are far fewer Homekit devices available on the market than other standards. Despite these problems, it works fine as a home automation hub as long as you don't mind the slow response time when you combine devices.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2018","Haik Sahakian",215
"Great for streaming movie/tv apps","Love this apple tv!I've been using a Smart TV to watch things like hulu, HBO, Netflix and needless to say, the apps have been very glitchy.This apple TV has been utterly glitch free. I love the interface of the apps on the apple TV compared with the smart TV. I suspect that apps on high profile devices like these are much more regularly updated and maintained than the apps on the smart TV which do not have ANY updates.each app works great. My internet connection is not the fastest but I've noticed no stuttering or buffering or loss of resolution.the remote is great. the top half of the remote is like a touchpad which is very responsive to your thumb. when trying to toggle between one or two items, I do find that it tends to be a little too much on the sensitive side and unfortunately there is no way to custom calibrate this. the voice feature works well - I've used this to search for shows and have encountered no errors so far.box blends in well with the TV stand and hides right behind my soundbar.screen mirroring is good too. for those of you with apple devices, it only makes sense to go with the apple TV. that being said, there are cheaper options out there such as Roku or chrome cast or the fire stick. so shop around and see what works best for your needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2018","frabjousday",215
"A noticable upgrade from Chromebox+Smart TV","I have a relatively recent Sony TV and we watch primarily Netflix and local content from NAS. I'd been using the TV's own player for Netflix and a Chromebox with LibreELEC for other stuff. Unfortunately the TV is incredibly slow to boot, it takes over a minute to the point where the first video starts playing. The other option, the Netflix plugin in OpenELEC/Kodi has a horrendous UI, even if/when it works. Also, the Chromebox couldn't control the TV, which was fairly inconvenient. Therefore I decided to look for a TV box that would substitute both.I had a few simple requirements, all of which I thought would be/should be easy to meet: 1. fast wake-up and menu navigation, 2. usable by my wife and kids, 3. a stable and usable remote with TV volume control 4. support for Kodi and Netflix 5. support for 4k in both Kodi and Netflix (judders due to frame rate mismatch really annoy me) 6. support for 4k in both Kodi and Netflix.It turns out that Netflix is really picky about what devices they approve for 4k playback, so requirement #6 eliminated all, but a handful of options (primarily Fire TV, Roku, Apple TV, Nvidia Shield). Of these, only the Apple TV and Nvidia Shield comes close to meeting the other points. The Shield fails on Netflix frame rate switching, while the Apple TV kind-of fails on Kodi support. Finally I decided that I'd rather settle for the pared-down Kodi experience that is sold in the app store under the name ""MrMC"" and got the Apple TV (I know I could side-load the full Kodi version, but with the certificate expiring every week it is a maintenance nightmare).So far I'm very happy with the Apple TV. It is a typical Apple experience, the customization possibilities are severely limited (especially compared to the Chromebox), but all the necessary functionality is there, and what is available works perfectly out of the box. I was positively astonished about the HDMI-CEC support. Not only did it work, but it correctly auto-detected every configuration parameter, including key mapping. The TV switches on and off in sync with the Apple TV, and I can even use the playback control buttons on the TV remote to control the Apple TV.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2018","Kerecsen Tamas",215
"Badly designed remote; biased search","I am coming from TiVo Roameo to Roku Ultra to Apple TV, so my review is informed by my experience on these other devices.The good:--Fine HD picture quality with no buffering and no micro-stutters (which I got with a Roku Ultra).--Crunchyroll app actually works right (unlike the Crunchyroll app on Roku)--Adequately responsive speed (unlike the TiVo).The bad:--Limited number of apps compared to Roku. I am on Comcast, and HBO GO and Showtime Anytime are available of the Apple TV, but not Starz Anytime.--Biased search results: If a movie in available for rental on Amazon Prime, searching for this movie in the main Apple screen does not reveal its availability on Amazon despite my having the Amazon Prime app installed. Instead, I have often seen in ""How Do I Watch This?"" a message to the effect that it is available on one of the cable premium pay services (like the aforementioned Starz), but no hint that it was also available to rent on a non-iTunes source.--Execrable remote: The touchpad is fiddly and twitchy, and you have to use either voice commands or the touchpad to do simple trick play like fast forward and rewind, which should have dedicated buttons like every other remote on the planet. It is astonishing that Apple, supposedly the King of User Experience, designed this thing.--Dated audio support with multichannel PCM as the default output format, meaning that the only way to use the Dynamic Range Control built into Dolby Digital is to activate it from the Apple TV and not from your receiver or TV.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2019","Robert2413",215

"Does what it's supposed to, after some tweaks","2 Probs with this machine. First, I guess sometime after our old 3rd gen apple tv, they decided to go cheap on their antennas. In the same place, running the same media, it was almost unusably slow. (Before I get a million comments from the apple worshippers, yes, I did all sorts of troubleshooting on it. It WAS the apple tv hardware.) Moved it further from electronics, got a little better. In order to use it properly, we had to buy powerline adapters to use with it. LAME to put such weak antennas on a $200 machine. Second, the remote. At first I thought it was cool, and so much easier swiping just right and left on the alphabet rather than up and down and left and right when typing stuff in with the old remote. But it's also annoying to be constantly swiping accidentally if you pick it up or it slides across the sofa, so I have mixed feelings about it. They ought to have some kind of little button or something so you can switch the touch on and off easily.

"BELIEVE THE REVIEWS CONCERNING THE GARBAGE REMOTE","As part of the internet/cable tv package I purchased 1-1/2 years ago, I had to choose between the cable companies' cable box w/remote or this Apple TV unit. Based on the glowing remarks from the cable tv rep, I was talked into buying the Apple TV unit for $200.00, 24 payments of $7.50/month added to my cable bill. BIG MISTAKE! When I received the Apple TV via UPS or Fed EX, there was a sticker on the outside of the box that informed you that once you opened the box, the unit was not returnable or refundable. I should have shipped this garbage back immediately. Instead, after making 16 of 24 payments to the cable company, I finally cancelled the cable tv service, but kept the internet because they are the only worthwhile option vs Frontier and similar services. The remote touch pad is either too sensitive when swiped or doesn't function at all when swiped. You can click the various buttons and nothing happens or something does happen after a major slow delay. User friendly this remote is not. I could go on and on about the underwhelming performance of the remote (just read the critical reviews), but you should also know that the Apple TV box can and does get very hot. At times,I placed it in the refrigerator to help cool it down. If heat kills laptops, then the same is likely true for this Apple box. There is a reviewer on June 7th that states, "" Do not believe all the negative reviews about the remote!"" WRONG! Definitely do believe the negative reviews concerning the remote. Basically, everything stated in the critical reviews happened to me with this piece of trash remote.

"Really disappointed in Apple","I’ve been Apple person for nearly two decades. I have stuck with them in spite of the higher cost than their competitors because I appreciate the durability and interoperability of their products. That all changed today. I purchased this device through my university bookstore last January and it has worked well since then.Two days ago, my tv screen flashed green and the AppleTV crashed and restarted. I thought it was strange, but continued on. Once the os had come back up, I tried to navigate back to where I had been in Netflix. The moment I tried opening Netflix, it crashed and restarted again. I tried everything: hard reboot, reset, reset and reinstall tvOS (most of those things many times).Finally I called Apple and they told me to do all of the things that I had already done. The operator I spoke to volunteered early on that my device was out of warranty and that the cost of repair was roughly the cost of purchasing a new device. While I appreciated his candor, the fact that Apple does not empower a senior tech support person to offer a repair or replacement for a device that is two months out of warranty has permanently soured me on this company.The AppleTV 4K costs nearly four times as much as comparable products from Amazon and Google. I was willing to pay that last year because I expected that the product would, like the many other Apple products that I have purchased over the years, last for a long time. However, when the hardware abruptly and fatally failed just a short time after the warranty expired and Apple customer service declined to offer a replacement on a fairly new device to a long-time customer, I decided hat it’s time to switch my technology life away from Apple.I just purchased a Fire Stick 4K for $50, and I am optimistic that it will interface with the Echo (which I presently just use as an alarm clock) with the same ease that my iPhone used to interface with my AppleTV.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2020","Daniel Horan",216
"Worth the upgrade","This model is fast compared to my previous unit, itv2. It sets up quickly and easy. Navigation and selection options are quick and helpful, sometimes too fast, e.g. overshooting target program (some due to remote’s slippery design). I’ve got it hooked up to a Sony XBR 65”4K and the video is ultra clear.I also upgraded sound bar (to mid range, $700, from $200 unit) and the video sound is awesome, e.g. Rolling Stones. I think the ITV put the sharp and precise audio separation with umpf! I got the 64mb unit to protect from future tech updates which is likely overkill; but 32mb should do it all now just fine. Bottom line, it’s a pleasure to use and imho, worth the $200 to upgrade from itv2.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2020","Stretched",216

It's twice as expensive as Roku Ultra and for all I know it's better in some ways, but I've never liked it because I could never get used to the remote.The Apple TV remote is so small it's very difficult to use. I'm not saying it can't get the job done, just that it's hard to hold and hard to master. In contrast, my Roku Ultra remote is easy to use. It has separate buttons for the various functions and I don't have to peer at the screen to see what's going on.I've seen some reviews where what the person liked was the unique remote, but you'd have to be a teenager to find it comfortable.

"Remote is terrible; Siri not great","February 15, 2019This device has the usual apps, including Amazon video and YouTube. It does not have Amazon music. It does not have a web browser.It is mindbogling that Apple, the originator of so many firsts in cool products, could take the vey functional remote of its earlier generation, and instead of simply adding an on/off button, a mute button, and a volume control, instead botched the entire thing from top to bottom. It has the worst remote I’ve encountered. It is supremely easy to drop, disappears instantly between cushions, immediately changes settings whenever you pick it up, and is very finicky when trying to select videos.Siri is sometimes helpful, but will not pick up some movies and series. It has trouble understanding some titles: can’t understand “Anne with an E”, or “Oldheim twelve”, for example.A good point: When using the Search function, my iPhone is alerted and connects me to the phone keyboard, so it is unnecessary to click letter by letter using the cludge on the TV screen.By the way, the Apple TV will supply Dolby Atmos automatically for select items but not for Amazon Prime. Likewise, the Firestick 4K will provide Atmos, (provided you hit the Options icon, scroll up to Audio and find Dolby Atmos listed and select it), but not for Apple products.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2019","Advisor",217

"Best 4K streamer ever...worst remote ever made","This is my 3rd iteration of the Apple TV...from the very first to the 4K version, so I'm obviously a fan. But frankly, Apple almost ruins a fantastic device by pairing it with a remote that is virtually impossible to accurately control. Trying to scroll up and down is a nightmare unless you have astonishingly good manual dexterity. No one I have handed the remote to has been able to scroll it without ending up in frustration.And using the Remote app on your iPhone is no better...worse actually, as it lacks the ability to control the volume on a home theater receiver.So that's the negative. The positive is that the quality of what appears on screen is as good as it gets, the apps are plentiful, and if you want to see Netflix and Amazon Prime in glorious 4K, this is the way to go. The 32GB version should be just fine unless you plan to use a boatload of apps or are a gamer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2018","RRS Camp",217
"Great Device to Stream Sports - Faster than Other Streaming Devices","Prior to purchasing my Apple TV 4K (did not purchase it on Amazon, so this is purely a product review), I'd owned a Roku Stick and a Chromecast. The primary apps I used were MLBTV, ESPN, Fox Sports Go, Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video. I thought both of them were great, but I knew I needed something faster. When my hometown baseball team wasn't playing, I liked to switch between baseball games on MLBTV. The Roku Stick and Chromecast simply do not have the hardware required to do this seamlessly. I decided I needed an upgrade.There aren't many surprises when you take it out of the box. It's a thick, squarish box with rounded edges. The remote is extremely thin, and there's a power cord. Disappointly no HDMI cable (wtf Apple!). Turning it on and connecting it, I noticed immediately how much faster it was than my Roku Stick and Chromecast. I also noticed there were many benefits I really enjoyed that I didn't expect. The ability to connect my AirPods and Bose headphones wirelessly to the Apple TV 4K was amazing. When my roommate was asleep in the next room, I could always switch to wireless headphones to ensure the audio output wouldn't wake him up. Using my iPhone as a keypad was also a huge plus. Gone were the days where I had to press button after button to type my email and password (and hear that annoying sound) on the Roku Stick!The remote was the only downside out of the box. It's tiny and super easy to lose. It's also very temperamental. If you have the remote sitting next to you on the armrest of a chair and accidentally brush up against the touch portion of it, it might disrupt your programming. However, the ability to use your iPhone to control the Apple TV (somewhat) makes up for this.Overall, I think your satisfaction will depend on how well the developers did developing your favorite app for the Apple TV. I can always count on MLBTV to have a top-notch app, but I ran into issues with the NBC Sports app. Playback was fine, but the audio differential between gameplay and commercials was unbearable. I even wrote to them, but they still didn't do anything to fix the issue. Before you purchase, I'd take a look and check out the reviews of the apps you're interested in. If you are an MLB fan, this is the best device to stream games on, hands down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2019","r86146",217

It integrates better with my music and podcasts, and everything updates seamlessly. I did have to google how to use the remote, but once I mastered it, it works great. I literally held my phone up to the apple TV, and it set itself up in a moment. Any time I have to type on the screen, it appears on my phone. This may not work as well if you aren't an iPhone user. I'm honestly not sure if that functionality is the same, but the apps and everything else function incredibly well. I had serious lag with the amazon fire stick after a while.

Died after two tries. Now Apple won’t take it back (mind you, it’s still under warranty) and the response is that there is a known software issue that should eventually be addressed once an update goes through.

"It's an Apple product.... but it could still be a little better IMO","If you're considering Apple TV 4K you probably know all the good stuff... Like all apple products, it's a premium device with excellent hardware, interface, apps, picture/sound quality and integration seamlessly with other IOS devices. It does all the stuff you already know Apple does well.That said, there's a couple of things that aren't so great (other than the price tag).1. The remote (this is a big one). It's premium for sure, but it's not user friendly at all, which really hurts the user experience.It's tiny and unergonomic, which makes it difficult to hold and navigate, and very easy to lose (easily falls between the sofa cushions, etc...). The touch interface is difficult to master, so you're constantly swiping past your selection or accidentally swiping when you try to click. It makes the user experience frustrating and time consuming, and contributes to ""hand fatigue"".Much like an iPhone it has a built-in rechargeable battery that is not serviceable. This means you'll need to recharge the remote every few weeks, which can be inconvenient, and if the battery ever fails the remote will need to be replaced.It does not have mute or power on/off buttons . Yes it support HDMI-CEC which can turn control your TV and other A/V equipment (but only if your equipment supports that feature) . Personally, I'd appreciate dedicated mute and power buttons.Basically they over engineered the remote, making it really ""cool"" but a nightmare to use, and the sad part is that it probably added $50 to the overall cost of Apple TV.2. Like all Apple devices each Apple TV must be associated with an Apple ID (account), but unlike an iPad, or iPhone, an Apple TV is not necessarily a ""personal"" device.You can switch between your families Apple accounts, but you have to navigate several layers into the settings menu to select the appropriate account. This should be an easy selection at the top menu, or home screen.At the end of the day, If you have a 4k TV, it's probably a ""smart"" TV, in which case your TV can do most of what this Apple TV 4K does (with the exception of access to Apple's ecosystem). But if you're an Apple household and want access to your Apple content on your home entertainment system, then Apple TV is the solution. If not there's better options for a fraction of the cost.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2019","Trusted Reviewer",219

"A perfect machine with a severely flawed remote","Love the TV itself. It is well made. Not much larger than my original apple TV but much more powerful. When I used my old apple tv (3rd gen) to airplay, sometimes it gets stuck. Now no more. Almost as smooth as wired external display. 4k contents on this thing are wonderful, especially if you can take advantage of their free 1080 -> 4k program.However, my actual experience with this TV is largely ruined because of the remote. I really REALLY hate this remote!! You could easily operate it by mistake because of the touch area. The idea of putting a touch control on a TV remote looks absurd for me because most people will keep staring at the TV even when they are using the remote. Without (almost) any tacnik feedback, you kinda have to move your eyes to the remote in order to touch/swipe it properly. To make things worse, the touch area responds differently every time. Sometimes you really need to move your thumb to make it respond. Sometimes you accidentally trigger it. I thought my unit was defective but it turns out every copy behaves like this.Operating this thing is just a disaster.I know that there are thumb gurus that could handle the remote really well.

Most of the ""apps"" are garbage and they are few.As a streamer, it's much improved and doesn't take a year to buffer 5 minutes of video ever 2 minutes like the older generations, but for far less money, you can get a Roku or Fire TV device that's every bit as good if not superior as a streaming device.Apple loves to force you to sign in to your account like every 3 days which is super irritating even with the awful Siri remote where you can technically speak your username and password, but good luck. Siri is pretty dumb and will misunderstand (all your commands really) and you will end up typing anyway.Then there is the annoying, ""verify your payment method"" that happens every week or 2 or the ""iTunes has updated it's terms of service"" which require you to get on an actual computer to sign in and verify your account when all you want to do is watch something on TV. *******THIS IS WHY I GIVE IT 2 STARS....

If this is something you happen to use a lot and love, that makes the Apple TV probably good for you and it gives you access to Apple Music (but why would you want to listen to music on your TV?) and access to purchases you made from iTunes. I only ever bought a few ala carte episodes of tv shows I missed before the days of stream everything, so I did not lose much here.

"A Big Step Forward for IPTV","The Apple TV 4K is definitely a 5 star product for certain people. You fit the bill if: You have a 4K TV, are heavily invested in iTunes, are willing to subscribe to Netflix or premium channels/already have cable and have a strong (above 20 MBPs) internet connection.UI: As per most Apple products the UI is pretty dang flawless. Navigating is easy and the Siri remote works wonderfully and is actually pretty fun to use.Apps: There are a TON of apps! A lot of them with free content. Comet, Shout Factory, Midnight Pulp, Mascot and Waves to name a few. If you have Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, etc. then this is definitely the best experience for all of them. Most work really well with Apple's ""TV"" app for endless bingeing. Not to mention: there's a boatload of games and other cool apps. Everything from webcams to shopping. You'll be surprised at what you can find on the App Store. AirPlay is a total boon as well. You can stream anything on your iPhone, iPad or Mac to the Apple TV... Even your home screen!Audio/Visual: One of my favorite features of the aTV is how highly intelligent it is in regards to different resolutions, frame rates, aspect ratios and dynamic ranges of video sources. Since it's recent software update the aTV is able to automatically switch all of these to give you the original content unaltered. Pretty neat. One big bummer is the lack of lossless audio. Still no DTS-HD, Dolby TrueHD or Atmos. A lot of other set-top boxes can already do this...Device: The box itself is super slick and small. It disappears well into your entertainment center and is completely silent. The ethernet port lives on for all you hardwire fans. It still has an IR receiver and it can ""learn"" commands from older remotes. Perfect for controlling A/V receivers and commands sent from Logitech Harmony devices or other universal remotes. The bad news is TOSLINK is no longer... Sorry stereo receiver folks.Overall: I'm really happy with my Apple TV 4K. I can definitely tell that this is the direction TV will be heading in the future and it's a good start. If you're like me and are still really into live TV and DVR functionality it probably won't replace your TiVo/cable provider box (unless you opt for DirecTV Now) but it's definitely a big step forward.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2018","lava41",220

This unit was already replaced under warranty and both the original and replacement boxes crash many times per day — even when not in use! Sometimes it works for hours at a time, and sometimes even after a full power cycle it crashes while I am just trying to scroll to a selection....When it works the audio and video quality are fine. As far as I can tell, the user interface is not customizable at all, so there is no way to rescale icons & labels to be more appropriate for a large 4K TV.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2019","John D.

"I LOVE this thing! Buuut.. update","Update, I still love this thing, in fact I bought a second one. I do notice that YouTube looks terrible on the Apple TV. I use my TVs built in YouTube app instead of the Apple TVs. The HDR feature looks bad while using YouTube and does not play 4K. Apparently Apple and google are fighting over who’s codec should be supported. I don’t care who “wins” but the consumer should not pay the price for the fight. Google is fighting with Amazon as well, so this is most likely a Google problem. The Nickjr app doesn’t look all that great either. I have children who use the app frequently and it’s colors are off compared to say Amazon/Netflix who’s picture looks amazing. It’s still a buy but there are a few annoyances.I have the Amazon Fire TV 4k and received the Apple TV 4K from a deal with Direct Tv Now. Comparing the two the Apple TV is better overall.A few major cons are the Apple TV is very restricted. No browser, require a Mac to sideload apps, no way to install a VPN with the exception of running one on your router. Sometimes the 4K upscale does not look good. I turned on the view in the native format setting to correct that issue.I LOVE the airplay option. Being able to send video from my iPhone to the tv is what makes this thing the best between the two products. You can download movies to your phone and send them to your tv. Netflix allows you to download their movies to watch later. You can also see your own iPhone videos and pictures through the feature which is cool!","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2018","Robert G Clifford",221

Actually, when you compare any Apple TV generation with its competitors in this category, the Apple TV pretty much bites. I purchased my Apple TV 4K and others because I love macs and iPhones, and it’s tough not to love Apple TV. Handling the remote is awkward and very difficult for people with hand trouble, like arthritis or dexterity. Even without these challenges, the remote aggravates easily due to button placement so close to the edges. Battery life is great, however. Other issues include frequent stopping and stream buffering during playback, limited app diplomacy for rentals, and security concerns when Airplay is not managed correctly by the owner.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2021","gemho",221

Clear, fast, no more buffering, a trackpad that doesn't drive me nuts, and it connected to my complicated home theater sound system so that I could control the volume from the Apple remote. Now I'm down to one remote for everything. I'm really pleased and I pay about half of what my media cost when I had the cable box.

I am in awe how bad it really is- I actually give Apple credit for it being so bad- its like they went out of their way to make it this bad. I cannot get over it. DO NOT BUY!!!!

Considering the iPhone operates with a very similar UI it amazes me this is so clumsy.Since you cannot rely upon the audio out you will most likely have to buy a cheap Chinese audio extractor because normal people do not rely upon their 10w TV speakers for their fantastic entertainment system with surround sound.It’s crazy because I can write this scathing review and it’s still the best product on the market.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2019","Eric B",222

"Constant restarts necessary after iOS 12","Initially I liked my Apple TV 4K. I thought of it as a stop-gap until I purchased all of my iTunes movies on other services that weren't tied to a particular hardware ecosystem. Light gaming war also a plus. The 4K in HDR is just stunning to watch. Something hasn't been right about this thing since iOS 12 though. The controllers (steelseries) will stop sending inputs to the Apple TV. While a restart almost always fixes it, this isn't what I've been told about Apple products. Then there's the remote. Get. A. Case. For. It. Period.

"Perfectly horrible","This device works - when it wants to. Often when it has already affixed to a network, you'll get a ""no internet connectivity"" message. This is an endgame. The ""no connectivity"" message scrolls through multiple languages and the only way it can be stopped it to completely unplug the unit and start over. The remote is a total joke. It uses the famous Apple ""gesture"" technology, where one swipes to move from place to place. However, it's always either undersensitive or oversensitive, so you can never get where you want to go by swiping the first, second, third or (usually) fourth time. The only thing that seems to work is the voice recognition - yay!, but almost every competitor now provides this, so it's clearly not enough to make the system particularly or uniquely useful. It is such a frustrating system that I threw the whole thing in the mud last night. I'm planning to drop a concrete block on it later today.

There are many different solutions on the internet for this problem. But power down & up is mine. I'm told HDCP is in place to keep people from pirating videos. In my case, no one could say except an older TV without HDMI 1.3 & once powered back up everything is fine. Power cycling the unit will shorten the life.

That has yet to happen, as I habe had to log in multiple times.While the visual interface is good, the way you maneuver through it is severely lacking. The touchpad is cool, but isn't as useful as buttons. The fastg forward and reverse controls are the worst. Flicking your thumb across the touchpad will sling your place over or back, there often doesn't feel to be a set amount. I'm sure I could get used to it, but why bother? There are much better control schemes with other products.The controller isn't great. It's very small and thin which, like the touchpad, is sleek and cool, but isn't the best for me.

The slide for fast forwarding can be set to slow and medium, but medium is still WAY too fast to easily use. Because it is so small, it has few controls buttons, and those control buttons have multiple uses--one click, two clicks, three clicks. But the worst is the slide for fast forwarding. It is just too sensitive for easy use for anyone (like ME) who are continually moving (or trying to move) backwards or forwards. And finally, no easy way to forward through commercials.

"The unit is pretty good. The remote is frustrating at best.","The apple TV itself is good. But it has two major issues. The first issue is that the apps written for it do not have the same oversight that flagship iPhone apps have. Several apps lag under either cpu limitations or poorly designed apps. This includes Youtube TV and DirecTV Now apps. They feel rushed. The apps freeze and you have to sit and wait 6-10 seconds for the apple TV to start responding again. Other times they work great. The second issue is the remote. The touch pad responds inappropriately constantly. One motion will take you to the right or left one object or no objects. The next time you do the same motion is goes 5 objects left, right, up or down. Its inconsistent at best. Other times the remote does nothing. The click works, but nothing else.

The box itself has been slow and laggy from the moment I opened it. The UI makes no sense to me at all. I guess if you ONLY use iTunes for media, it works? Me? I’ll stick with my roku.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2018","Reed Adams",224

"Is Apple forcing old users to upgrade?","I am disappointed with Apple and ordering another streaming device(s). I have several older Apple TV devices that mysteriously stopped streaming photos, now that their new Apple TV 4K is out. Photos is what I use it for at my business. I have had a case open with Apple for almost a month and they tell me it is a known problem and they should have it fixed soon. You can not imagine the frustration of each morning rebooting, entering all the password and login info that takes forever on their remote, click by click, only to get the same error message.

"Decent device, lousy remote control.","I use this as my main TV controller - streaming DirecTV Now and Amazon Prime. Great picture and sound quality, but the box has a habit of going to sleep and unable to wake it back up. Only solution is to remove power to reboot. Probably happens 3-4x per week. Also, the remote is Pure Crap. Slippery as a wet bar of soap, and is badly in need of a page up/down function. The scroll is just not good.

"Great for DTVN, much smoother than Fire TV box","I have both Apple TV 4K and 1st gen FireTV box hardwired to a VPN router running at 75 mbps.Pros: Very smooth, with no buffering with DirecTV Now (at least for last 2 days), whereas my FireTV box buffers occasionally - especially during prime time. Of course, the Apple TV costs twice as much.I made DTVN my default TV service, and under included TV app, I downloaded several TV apps which are designed for DTVN.After a few minutes learning curve, I found out out to rearrange TV channel icons.Cons: Wonky remote. Buttons work fine, but track pad at top is terrible - I have a hard time consistently navigating menus and tv channels with it. Sometimes it’s okay, sometimes it jumps past where I want it to go.Annoying.As a result, I used the Neoteck Bluetooth mini keyboard I bought here on Amazon 3-4 mos ago. Originally bought for FireTV (works perfect), but after I paired it with Apple TV, I found out mouse tracking doesn’t work - although everything else does (keyboard, directional keys etc). Just make sure to press Fn + F1 keys when pairing to Apple TV.If anyone has a mini keyboard whose mouse trackpad works well with Apple TV 4K, PLEASE let me know.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2018","truthplz",225

I have a wired broadband connection and in the middle of movies and shows (Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, iTunes, DC Universe and others) the connection drops and the progress circle just turns and turns. Rarely, it reconnects but more often than not, I have to back out and try again. My network connection is fine and all other connections are working fine. This only happens on the 4K box, the other earlier versions of AppleTV do not have this problem. This may be a software problem as it was never this bad, but as of late it happens, very, very frequently. I could find no fixes on the Internet and the only references I could find that were similar involved wireless connections, so this might be new.

"Anticompetitive Apple","I received this as a Christmas present and have hooked it up. It works well but suffers from a serious problem of apple’s making. As you know Apple has a history of anticompetitive behavior (it was convicted of a federal felony a few years ago for creating a price fixing cartel for streaming books) and it has now maliciously designed appletv to block your ability to rent or buy movies from Amazon. If you buy this you will a work around apple’s anticompetitive restrictionsWhat I was forced to do was install an Ethernet splinter and hookup my Roku box and the Apple TVThe I use the Roku to access my Amazon prime account and rent or buy moviesApple could have chosen to compete on the merits for our business by offering cheaper rentals or a broader selection. They deliberately chose not to do that and instead try to force appletv customers to by their movies from appleThis is seriously anti consumer and anticompetitive but it will not work.

"Disabling auto-updates is technically possible","I really liked the Apple TV 4K at first, which is why I preferred not to update its software. Apple software historically creates problems like slowdowns and crashes. Unfortunately, updates are mandatory. Disabling automatic updates is possible, but that doesn’t stop incessant full screen update prompts, which rely on an accidental button press to force updates that cannot be canceled once they begin. The only options are to immediately update, enable auto updates, or update later. This disruption occurs every time the Apple TV is woken up or if the user doesn’t interact with the device for a few seconds, like on the YouTube homescreen. Pitiful choice from a company that once made the best user interfaces.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2020","A. Cruz",225

The cursor movements are erratic and the time it takes to get used to using it is just too long and too laborious. I STOPPED using the 4K Apple TV and just started hooking up my MacBook or just using the smart TV for what I need. Very disappointing for an Apple user like myself!","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2018","Abignewfie",230
"Overengineered much?","I recently converted from original apple tv streaming to the newest 4k model While fast, it feels completely overengineered. Every time you bump it on the sofa, something flashes on the screen or it rewinds. Remote is sensitive and tricky and any adjustment morphs into a 15 minute experience to get back where you were. Overall, it's cumbersome to use, tricky to operate, and very difficult to integrate","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2020","Kevin Witcher",230

"Apple TV 4k: Great interface but woeful performance","The Apple TV integration with multiple streaming services is what attracted me to the device and by far is the only reason to use it, but it needs more CPU power, or better WiFi, or whatever it is that is affecting performance, and in some cases leaving you with a black screen for so long that you suspect that it has died.

"Great Variety Of Offerings, But Far From Flawless","I'm not a shill for Amazon, but I'm starting to regret not getting their Fire TV after making this purchase. True, I am able to streamcast from my iPhone and iPad to this device without issue, but I find that the box has a tendency to freeze (even with the apps closed) and that if you errantly keep other apps open (as less tech-savvy people probably will because who wants to have to worry about that when watching TV?!), your cable/satellite/tv provider account will be temporarily locked for having too many accounts open. Plus I'm a huge wrestling fan and while I enjoy streamcasting New Japan World onto my Apple TV, I could be watching it natively on the Amazon Fire Stick. If Apple could address the freezing issues (and perhaps open up the offerings a bit to be competitive with Roku and Amazon), I would give it a higher rating.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2018","Mike",231

"WORST remote ever designed!","Beware – this remote has a glass surface that breaks VERY easily, so goodbye entire Apple TV functionality and the money you paid. Plus, it is the most poorly designed remote I've ever used – you can't tell which end you are holding (even worse in the dark while you're watching TV!) so you'll be touching or clicking the touchpad and changing what's on your screen without meaning to. Also, it's uncomfortable to hold – and slips out of your hand as you gingerly try to pick it up without brushing against the overly sensitive touchpad. Major FAIL from Apple – I expect so much more from a company who prides itself in innovative design, but here function has been sacrificed for some college-level design 'coolness'.

"RIP Apple TV (Why, and survival tips)","Sadly this is my first negative review for Apple. Ever. I’ve enjoyed their products for a very long time. It this one, no. I’m technical. These are verified facts on a Meraki router.The unit will spin endlessly not telling you it dropped the network connection. It will stall and 100% for sure Apple on the title you’re viewing isn’t steaming. Pick another title, bam. Go back. No. It will stop getting bandwidth at all from Apple but will if you reset it. It wull go berserk and consume 65mbs continuous for 14 hours straight (I halted it) if you set for daily screensaver updates. Signed up for HBO Now? That app will now force you to go register on their site. When you do chokes and says you’re already registered under your email (duh) but you’ll be stuck then use another email account. So you’d think you could log into HBO Now stand-alone, right? No dice. No worries though you’ll still get billed via your AppleID. The remote. Epic total fail. But no problem use an older remote. Solved. Got an iPhone and want to sling the screen like you used to? Awesome for up to ten minutes. It will drop you. Every time. Couple of survival tips next. Fist set the screensavers to never download. Second turn off all podcast and background app updates. Turn off auto update. If you don’t and you have a data cap you’ll be sorry. Even if you have a pro router and enough bandwidth of you don’t it will suck so many cycles you will have sluggish behavior everywhere else. (That’s on 150 fiber!). This device will also drop and reconnect to your network nearly continuously: you can fix that though if you can set up your network for only WPA2.

"Apple - What Happened to You?","Just set it up for my wife. I have several ROKU's and Fire TV's and Apple TV is (simply) a pain. The privacy settings, having to activate an Apple ID is similar to privacy incursions like the other providers. Surprisingly even at twice the price with the competition, Apple TV did not even come with an HDMI cable - plenty of protective tape but no cable? In my opinion the remote is not ready for prime time: The ability to act as a touch pad is cumbersome, inaccurate and annoying. SIRI is no better with its mistakes and limited recognition, although it has a voice interface with DirectTvNow when on the menu (I think). And, I say ""I think"" because it is not consistent. However, Google's voice recognition technology is much more accurate. Apple's Glitches abound. For example, I downloaded HBO Now by mistake as I wanted to download HBO Go. The device refused to remove the mistaken application - Once loaded then you are stuck with the application. This makes for a very crowded interface. In addition, once I downloaded HBOGo, I got a message that Apple TV does not support the application! I have no problem saying that I get much more satisfaction and utility from my twenty-nine dollar ROKU and ROKU Premiere.Update: After some more experience with the remote it is not as glitch as I first noted. There are some superior features. For example, I can scroll through the DirectvNow menu very efficiently than holding down Roku's button. I also found out how to delete apps. And, the glitch with HBO Go was my error.

"Very expensive, limited in functionality, and anchored to an Apple only ecosystem","Unless you jail break it, it is pretty useless and way too expensive and limited for a streaming device. If you use your Apple TV to watch Netflix or Amazon TV/Movies, you are wasting your money and would be better off buying a Roku. If you want to install Kodi on it but don't own a Mac, you are out of luck, and there are much cheaper devices on the market that install and run Kodi from the play store. What I am trying to say is that for the money you pay for Apple TV, it's way to limited, doesn't support third party remotes or keyboards, is only slightly useful in an Apple only ecosystem, and for Gods sake doesn't even have USB ports!","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2018","Amiz",239

"Still the worst Apple product out there. Don't buy it!","You want to be frustrated every time you sit down to watch TV? This product is for you. You want a remote that does the opposite of what you want it to do? This product is for you. You want to be reminded how much Apple design has gone down, this is the perfect product for you because no actual design went into the making of this thing.I’m a lifelong Apple fan and bought this from Apple directly but I now spend my days wanting to the stupid remote at my TV every time I try to use it. I find myself yelling at the TV and cussing out Apple EVERY. SINGLE. DAY! Hope lots of people get fired over this thing. DIE APPLE TV!Some of the main problems include the remote being too sensitive or not sensitive enough. The touch pad does whatever it wants to do. When trying to select any app on Apple TV, the first two tries are usually incorrect since the remote slides to the nearest app that next to the one you want to open and then opens that app that you didn’t want.The menu button is actually a back button (or the screensaver button or who knows).The other button with the TV icon is also a back button, a menu button, or who knows. Basically does the first thing as the first one, but not really… just enough similar stuff to confuse you and make the remote the least intuitive thing. You have to really really REALLY FOCUS AND CONCENTRATE when you’re using this terrible product, otherwise you’re going to spend time exiting apps, clicking on menu options you didn’t mean to, restarting your device, throwing your hands up in the air… and giving up completely on watching whatever you wanted to watch on TV.Also, what's up with the UX for apple TV? you swipe right to select the app on the right, but if you want to completely close an app (double clicking on the TV icon), sliding right makes things go the opposite direction than when you're in the main screen. Why would apple do this? To confuse you, to piss you off, or most likely because their design team phoned it in while sipping liquor from a remote island.Youtube app.... let me not even get into how bad this is. It's obviously an Apple ploy so you don't log into youtube that often. All i know is that Apple makes it 1000% harder for you to watch youtube and it makes me hate Apple for that because no matter what they do I’m still going to watch Youtube even if I have to do it away from my Apple TV.Listening to music is also terrible. The menus are so bad that when trying to select a song or playlist it will take 2 to 3 attempts. Your music library is on the right hand side of the screen, but when you first open iTunes you're actually on a different tiny menu at the top of the screen. Intuitively I scroll to the right because i see my playlists there - but if I scroll to the right, the stupid apple TV takes me to the next menu option on the tiny menu at the top - so now i have to try again remembering to first scroll down then left (even though in Western society we read things left to right followed by top to bottom). Same things happens on the Youtube app, except that when you switch menus for any reason (mostly on accident thanks to the bad UX design), your video suggestions change and anything you might have wanted to watch is gone and now you have to go to your phone or computer to try to find it.Anyways, the Apple TV 4K is a work in progress like it’s always been. Save your money and yourself from frustration by not buying this thing.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2018","Mario Garcia",240
"Prepare for Disappointment","You're going to regression tthis ourcjase pretty quickly. To begin with, when it actually works, Apple TV 4K is actually alright. The picture is nice and the sound is even better. Bit that's where the joy ends. For starters, I have to physically unplug the init at least 4 times a week to restart it because it froze or refused to turn on. Annoying. Then the remote. I challenge you to use this remote for a week and bit hate everything Apple has ever done. It's small, unresponsive, not even ""remotely"" ergonomic, and super easy to use. The OS is the most annoying of all boxes to navigate, with regular buttons not being present on the remote creating an inability to properly navigate and utilize most apps. Do yourself a favor and buy ANY other streaming box and save the heartache. Got mine from Best Buy, returned it less than a week later.

The Apple TV came with no user manual. The remote was not intuitive at all and on screen help is non-existent. I had to go online and figure out how to use the remote. Navigating the menus is cumbersome involves several steps to get the job done.Also you must have Apple ID and have to join iTunes to use the AppleTV.Worst user experience I have ever had.

"This was very easy to install to our TV!","My husband bought Apple TV 4K (32GB latest model) for my birthday today. We had it connected within ten minutes. We were prepared after reading all the reviews about how the remote was difficult to use at times however we found it was not a problem and in-fact if you have an iPhone you can actually use that as your remote. The actual picture on our 4K Sony TV is beautiful. You can the Apple TV to watch all your channels if you want. It’s easy to set up. We highly recommend it. The only concern is if you don’t already have an Apple iTunes/music account for $9.99/month then you need to get one as well as pay $4.99/month for Apple TV. So be aware of that since I already have an account it was not a problem.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2020","S. J.",246

"Another slick, powerful Apple device. Fancy remote can be fiddly.","We replaced our older Amazon Fire box because we were considering limiting our cable television to streaming, and the Amazon box apparently doesn't support the Spectrum app. We decided not to go that way, but the Apple TV has been a good unit.The Apple TV was reasonably simple to install although I ran into an issue where it would not accept a splitter I had on our older TVs last HDMI input to select between a DVD player and the streaming box. Apparently the Apple TV demands a lot of throughput, and we got a higher-quality cable and removed the splitter. Once on, it walks you through the process of setting everything up with voice prompts, etc. Hard to mess it up.The picture is amazing. Razor-sharp and noticeably better than the cable box. Our older Sony TV doesn't support 4k, but it I remember it advertised being able to interpret higher-resolution signals to some extent and it's just stunning through the Apple TV.Apple's interface is more complicated than the Amazon box, with several layers you sometimes have to dig through to get to what you want, although that's a pretty quick process of hitting the ""menu up"" or ""home"" button. It does sometimes have an issue with Apps (like Amazon) where you're logged in already and if you've left that window open, you have to go back to it or close the first window before selecting the app. It all works, but it's more to deal with than the simpler Amazon interface.Ameliorating the complexity is Apple's super-powerful voice-interface. It does more than at least the old Amazon box did, turning captions on and off (handy) and searching, although sometimes it won't ""find"" something unless you're already in the right app for the right streaming service. Unlike Amazon's system, where you can just speak at the (newer) devices or your Echo unit, you have to push a microphone button, but it's also cool that you can literally whisper into it and it will ""hear"" you perfectly.Speaking of the remote, the tiny, thin, rechargeable Apple remote is cool, with its sleek aluminum back and fancy touchpad, but that touchpad can be fiddly, sometimes refusing to fast-forward or reverse if you haven't pressed the edge in exactly the right way. And just brushing your arm across it inadvertently can start issuing commands when you only wanted to pick up your drink. Offsetting that a bit is that if you have Apple devices like iPhones or iPads lying around, the devices will prompt you to use them as remotes, which also lets you type on a keyboard to put in long passwords, a real pain on other systems where you have to painstakingly pick out individual characters on the screen. I am seriously considering a 3d party remote to get some simpler hard buttons though.There are more advantages for Apple folk. You can stream photos from your computers, which the Apple TV spookily prompts you to link to. And you can easily stream material from your iPhone or iPad to the screen, which is handy when something is only available online.We like the Apple TV and will be keeping it. It's got the usual sky-high Apple quality, tech and slick features, and the usual Apple quirks that can be frustrating. However, having set up the fancy new Amazon Cube for my parents, which lets them control their entire entertainment system by speaking at their Echo devices, I'm sure I did the right thing getting them that instead, and can see how others might prefer it.Five stars. No-brainer for Apple devotees; maybe not the best if you don't have other Apple devices or don't like tech with a bit of a learning curve.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2021","Orlando J.",247

"Superb picture and sound quality, range of apps and channels surpasses the Roku","I was looking to replace a Sky HD+ service and to be honest to replace some less than stellar roku boxes. I used to love the Roku 2 as it gave the best range of apps and channels and was fairly easy to configure and use, unfortunately from version 3 of the Roku box onwards I’ve either struggled to connect to the TV, achieve anywhere near decent picture quality or pair the renote. So enter the Apple 4K TV device, it has the typical IOS interface but allows connection of Amazon Prime, Netflix, Britboz, UKTV Play etc plus of course Apple TV. Driving the interface with the supplied remote takes a fair bit of getting used to and defaults whenever you press a key it wasn’t expecting to open the Apple TV app which can be a bit irritating, the good news is you can drive the Apple box using your existing TV remote (or at least I could using my Phillips Ambilight TV remote).The best part about this device is the absolutely stunning picture quality - when it says 4K it means it and the sound is pin sharp too. The device even set my HDR configuration on my TV to display the picture in the best way possible.To top it off you even have Siri available on the remote, so if like me you can’t work out how to open and close apps or ‘show episodes’ rather than play the next one in a box, set Siri understands most garbled commands and is far more forgiving and intuitive than Amazon’s Alexa when you don’t use the exact command it’s looking forIf you are considering this product to be a little expensive, like most Apple tech it is, but the benefits are worth it, and go for the highest storage you can it improves the flow of programs you are streaming. On the downside don’t expect any glitches you do find (and there are a few for example getting it to show-up as a HDMI feed when in sleep mode) to be fixed any time soon - that’s just not the Apple crew’s jam","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on July 9, 2021","Anita K",250

My five year old daughter has no trouble using the remote to find her favorite films and 4K HDR movies with full 5.1 surround sound are truly a thing to behold if you have the kit for it.Probably the biggest surprise feature was if you install all the other apps you subscribe to ie Netflix, prime tv and Disney life etc when you search for a movie the Apple TV will tell you if it’s on any of those platforms and play the movie from there rather than having you pay for it from iTunes.All in all so good I bought a second one for the bedroom.

I always thought i had this internet issue when I tried to play high-res netflix on my tv, but it turns out my tv's graphics processor was just burning its little heart out. tv on this thing looks amazing, and it's convenient as hell. I cannot find the remote if you pointed a gun at my head and threaten me with eternal damnation and this just about solved that. Unlike similar devices like the fireTV, I can type stuff into it with a real, full qwerty keyboard via my iphone, AND it integrates with 1Password / iCloud keychain to automatically enter passwords for google and netflix and stuff, so i dont awkwardly type them letter by letter in public view at some extremely important time when i have friends over. it's good and i hope its price doesn't prevent it succeeding, it really deserves to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on April 24, 2019","Zemnmez",250

I have been heavily into Itunes from the start and now with all my favourite streaming apps in one place and the best place to watch You tube videos this is a must connected to the TV. The HDMI connection now handles audio as well as video and to an excellent quality, so gone is the fibre optic connection on the previous version. All purchases via the apple store are available without downloading the full content and now with the app store for games and more it can only improve, The only black mark against Apple is that the older versions of the hardware becomes less and less usable with the older apps not supported or deleted from their system.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on April 24, 2021","Softchew",251

"Worth the high price?","I have a Chromecast and a fire stick already and needed an appleTV for work reasons. I assumed that it was much more expensive than the other devices because it was the usual apple desirability tax so I wasn’t expecting it to be any better or worse than than the fire stick or chrome cast but I was very wrong. The picture quality and the audio (to a lesser degree) are a big improvement on both the other devices. The picture is particularly good. Really clear and crisp and great Colour reproduction. The OS isn’t better than the fire stick it’s about the same and the remote which I initially thought was cool has become slightly annoying as the gesture control is flaky and difficult to use sometimes and the remote is difficult to work out if it’s the right way around in the dark. What is great if you have an iPhone is the integration of having the Apple TV remote controls accessible on your lockscreen. Also screen mirroring works really well. If you are in the apple eco system and picture and audio quality are important to you then this is definitely the streaming device I’d go for. It’s worth the price increase in my opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on August 2, 2020","Andy L",251

"On the Fence......","Where to start. I have both the Fire Cube and the Apple TV. Both have their pros and cons.When it comes to setting Resolution and Hz Apple Wins. Not sure why Amazon keep hidden the 24p and 25hz options. Set 4K 60hz SDR and leave it at that. Amazon's Automatic 4k does not choose a 4K resolution or forced set to 4K@24Hz never sticks.Match Frame rate and Dynamic range. This is in apples favour. It works but apple does have a an actual 24 fps problem (not 23.976 but 24.00 if the content is true 24p and not NTSC 23.967 or 23.98). They match it but at the set resolution of your box. It will not match resolution just the FPS of the content and match the dynamic range of the content so if it's Dolby vision it will kick up to Dolby Vision. Amazon could learn from them on this front.Audio hmm for a 4K product this should be able to bitstream and not output everything as PCM. This is where Amazon wins as my receiver should be able to decode it.Apps. Again Amazon wins. There is much more apps on the Amazon fire TV then there is on the Apple TV. More choice can be better.Remote. I do get along with the apple remote but it could of been better. I prefer actual buttons and this is where the amazon remote wins. Buttons that are for the actual command does wonders.The interface I do find I like Apple's TV app more. I seem to be able to find things a bit more easier and it's good on recommendations.Each has their pros and cons. If Amazon's Match frame rate and resolution worked with third party apps or when I set the resolution and remained set when I set it to 2160p@ 24hz it would not be a problem. Amazon need to step up and stop with just 50 or 60hz only options. Each has it's pros and cons. so the choice is yours.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on May 14, 2020","StargazerUK",262
"Simplistic streaming device for IOS users","This is a great streaming device for us Apple IOS users, and for those who have a large iTunes library it's a no brainer. The design is simple but beautiful, the inputs you need at there and work first time every time.This is the 3rd Apple TV I've owned and setup wasn't as easy as the others, Lag was crazy at first... which wherever I searched came up with the same solution.... fix your network. I did this, and it didn't help. What I did realise after looking through the settings extensively, is that the device after doing its initial set up, didn't realise my TV was 60hz and defaulted to 50hz. It also did not set itself to Chroma 4:2:2 which I have the correct cable for.After manually setting up the Apple TV myself all lag disappeared, and the picture was visibly clearer and smoother.Everything else is standard Apple, integration in to the eco system is seamless and work flawlessly.Apps are a bit meh and need working on from Apple's perspective, think app store for Mac lol.Music integration is standard Apple.Every other streaming service is on here too.Best thing about this is if you have a big library of films and a 4K TV, the upgrade to 4K on any films are free if you bought the HD version, a rare freebie given by Apple.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on February 8, 2019","Mr Paul N Brewin",262
"Probably the best box for 4K content","I bought the box having recently upgraded my tv to a 55” 4K model so wanted to maximise my 4K content.ProsGreat range of 4K content at very reasonable prices in the apple store. You also regularly get extras with these purchases similar to a dvd.Remote works great although takes a little getting use to (I also use my iPhone as a remote especially for typing)I have both a uk and us iTunes account, the box lets me switch between them at the touch of a button to access both libraries.All the main apps are there.Picture quality on the menus and content are great.ConsMost games are rubbish.Apps are very limited compared to us store.No google play apps(but YouTube can be used to view google purchases)Overall a very well polished but of kit and superior in most ways to my Android shield tv, but still need both to cover all areas.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on December 16, 2018","Oldino",262

Whilst a previous Apple product I purchased on Amazon turned out to be a fake, I can attest that this is an official Apple TV. At the time of my purchase, this was cheaper than buying from Apple direct, but not by a huge amount - also, it's not packaged as well as if sent from Apple, thus mine arrived with a dented box.2. The picture quality is mostly great (as you would expect from 4K) however, I found that the quality from Netflix looked better via the app on my TV than it does via the Apple box (since investigation, I've learnt that I'm not the only one who has found this).3. You can upload your own videos to the internal hard-drive if you download the VLC app - there are plenty of websites that tell you how to do this. Apple have deliberately made this a painful process as they want you to buy their films from iTunes.4. Given that you can get Prime, Netflix, iPlayer etc. from most smart-tv’s these days, this might only be worth the purchase if you have (or plan to build) an extensive iTunes library.5. The remote is hit and miss… sometimes it is genius and sometimes it seems too over-sensitive.6. Voice-control is pretty accurate and seems to find what I ask to search for 99% of the time - in addition, it seems to search all the apps you have to give you a choice of where to buy/rent/watch the movie from.7. You can use your phone to manually search and/or enter a password which is simple but effective (I hate having to select a letter at a time from a TV digital Qwerty keyboard).I’m mostly happy - it is after all a very clever piece of technology. I should point out that I had a number of vouchers to use to reduce the price and I have quite a few iTunes movies - if either of these points hadn’t have been the case I would have been disappointed, as nearly all apps are available in modern TV’s / Games consoles and movies that aren't made by apple can be played from a USB stick.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on February 21, 2019","Stephen",263

"High price but quality","This is a grate device if you have a bunch of apple stuff but give it a miss if you have a good mix of devices in your home like android because you can get a roku for £50 that will work just add well except for apple products. From apple devices sending pictures an video you have taken to the apple tv is effortless and very quick the main apps are all topnotch like netfix and now tv. I use a multi remote to control all my stuff the apple tv can be set up to respond to any remote you want it simply saves the ir signals from the remote u want to match the buttons on the Apple tv remote. I also have a synology nas I'm using ds video to play movies on the Apple tv it works best with the original remote because skip won't work on only this app this app.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on March 11, 2019","Big Boss M",263
"Now tv App rubbish","Not too bad to set up using the swipe handset. Purchased this so we could have all the apps on the same box unfortunately the NOW TV app is rubbish, so I am using it in the bedroom until the App is updated then will use in the Lounge, so still having to use my tablet to cast some apps to tv.I have got used to the swipe handset after buying a case to keep it in, however will probably try and get the Salt remote from Switzerland when I start using downstairs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on June 12, 2020","mastanlem",263
"Let down by remote","Works well as central place to access all catchup and streaming apps such as Amazon, Netflix and Youtube. Also one of the few ways of watching the new Britbox on a TV rather than ipad/phone/PC. Interface familiar to anyone with a smart phone - especially those familiar with IOS.Apple TV has very limited free content, but the Morning Show much better than expected from the reviews.Works really well in conjunction with apple music (subscription required) with many songs available with lyrics that scroll as the song plays - great for Karaoke. Can also access a massive choice of music videos. Also easy to link with your own itunes library on a PC on the same network. However the software needs improving. Should be able to group albums together for easy viewing but only way is to generate a massive playlist of individual tracks.The worst thing is the remote. Its too sensitive - even with practice. Voice controlled search is pretty good most of the time in recognising your voice accurately. Within the music app once you select search, you then have to scroll down to use voice activation, often going past the correct point due to the already mentioned oversensitive touch pad. The remote itself is not very nice or ergonomic to hold. Too minimalist and too small. Just discovered the lower half of the remote face is made of glass - which has now fractured after drop on hard floor. This has happened within a month of ownership, all other remotes are undamaged despite years (in some cases) of use. - not impressed. Have now ordered a protective cover - for which there is a massive choice on Amazon - I wonder why!Picture quality is very good. Screen savers have a lot of interesting content but you dont seem to be able to just select the ones you like best.Sound is also very good when played through hifi system, especially the music.To summarise, great access point to multiple TV apps and music, either your own or by subscription, Remote needs improving and control software not up to apples usual standard.Definately worth getting but looses 2 stars due to poor remote and poor Apple TV free content.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on December 10, 2019","Richard L.

"Fantastic","You get what you pay for at the end of the day, this is the best streaming box money can buy and that’s why it’s more expensive than others.

I always liked the old style rotary disc.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on September 26, 2019","Richard Greatrix",263
"Great content but navigation could be less fiddly","Excellent viewing content and quality. Shame the remote is small, minimalist and has a touch panel that I find hard to use to navigate screen content.

"Easy setup but practically no content.","Like all Apple products this is a thing of beauty and you won't mind it showing on your desktop or next to your TV. Setup was a complete joy and silky smooth experience. If you already have apple iPhones or iPads then it's guaranteed but if you haven't your experience may be only slightly less pleasurable. It is slick and quick.Picture quality on a 4K display is excellent, especially if you have the right cable and display to view full 4K @60Hz. The remote control is super intuitive once you realise which half of it you should be sliding your fingers and thumbs on. The on-screen display gets some getting used to but if you know how to go back via the remote you can explore all the options in half an hour or less. All the free content is via free downloadable apps like iPlayer and ITV Play etc.When I bought this I got an offer of a one year subscription to Apple TV+ thrown in for free. Therein lies a problem with the Apple TV. When you first fire it up you think the lack of included content other than the BBC iPlayer etc is because you don't have subscription to Apple TV+ and then you get a subscription you realise there isn't much content on there either and what is there may be big budget, like 'See', but there isn't much 'must view'. Anything else like the latest films you need to pay extra for. If you already have an Amazon Fire 4K TV stick (which is considerably cheaper) and a fast wi-fi network, then there isn't much to be gained from buying an Apple TV.So overall a well designed device that feels good and looks good but doesn't really deliver the goods when it comes to content yet. I use the word 'yet' more in hope than expectation.Update - The remote control continues to be more annoying than Piers Morgan (UK Viewers) and less responsive to my needs. Buy an Amazon FireTV 4K instead for less than half the price and you can watch the apple stuff, which still isn't much, through that instead.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on November 27, 2019","Chris Hatfield",264

"stick with fire TV","I have used fire TV for the last few years but decided to go with something different when my old fire TV started to play up a little bit. I wish i had just stuck to a new fire TV! the apple is a great quality picture however after that its just a pain to use. it will not let you install an IP vanish app , if you want to protect your privacy you are going to need to take your wifi feed from say a laptop with an IP vanish app already installed or buy some form of hardware to sit between your router and you apple tv box. The remote is just a pain to use and i can see why it recommends an updated remote now when you buy the tv box. many apps are blocked from being installed such as kodi. there is a way around it but its going to cost you approx $25 for a year. Apple tv app is a pain. It says its free for 1 year but then after watching a few episodes of a show it will not let you watch anymore until you sign up and enter payment details! i am leaving this review just before i am about to purchase a fire TV which as you have probably guessed by now i wish i had done in the first place!!","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on January 21, 2020","Martin Lagar",265

"Overpriced but by far the best streaming system","I’ve used a range of TV streaming options and this is the best. It’s by far the most expensive too, and it’s hard to say if it’s worth paying nearly 10 times more than a Fire Stick for basically the same thing. You do need an Apple ID to sign in to this.But it just works, like most Apple things. Everything is effortless, your photos from iCloud are there. You can screen share from an iPad, iPhone or MacBook with the press of a button. It’s a joy to use, there are no annoying third party apps to download or sub menus to navigate. The user interface is intuitive and simple to use. The supplied remote is a little dinky but most connected TV remotes will operate it too.The Apple TV app includes programmes viewable on the Apple TV+ subscription, but also brings together programmes on all the apps, allowing for easy searching and picking up the last watched programme.Picture quality is superb, with Dolby Vision and Dobly Atmos built in, which gives super results on a compatible TV. There are all the apps I want in the Appstore. Games are also available, which aren’t my thing at all, but having tried them it doesn’t come close to a proper gaming system. It’s a little puzzling really as you’re paying for a higher end system, but it’s still no playstation in terms of processor power, so it falls in the middle. It’s really therefore more of a luxury streaming device with semi-impressive gaming potential.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on May 2, 2021","Ac88",268

"Superseded by TV's better built-in app and features.","AppleTV has been around for a while now, and I've always been a big fan... until I went for a new 4K HDR TV (LG OLED CX55) and now suddenly it seems rather lacking.Here are the problems:The (still) dreadful text input mechanism that arranges the alphabet in one big line across the screen, so you have to move left/right to select letters. This makes entering usernames/passwords extremely cumbersome, and for passwords there's no option to show the password, so even more frustrating if you lose your place.It doesn't support 7.1 surround sound... only 5.1. In 2020 this is unforgivable. Even the Sony PS3 (released in 2006) supports 7.1!Movies under the Disney label are not available in 4K HDR / Dolby Vision from Apple's own store, but are via the Disney+ app.The LG TV (and probably your own brand of smart tv) already comes with superior versions of YouTube, Prime, Disney+, iPlayer and even AppleTV!The above apps properly support LG's remote control (the mouse pointer thing... which I love, and which mostly solves the text entry issue).The above apps have full support for proper 7.1 surround sound.And smart TVs these days have built-in support for screen casting too... and it seems to be more stable than the AppleTV version.It still doesn't support ""Hey Siri"" (because it has no built-in microphone)... you have to buy a HomePod for that.So really the only reason to buy an AppleTV Device in 2020 is if:* You don't have a smart TV* You want to stream items from your home iTunes library (via the very buggy ""Computers: app)* You want to make Homekit work from outside your house and be able to use a small selection of the features.Very disappointing; I expect better from Apple.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on November 29, 2020","Amazon Customer",269

"Unreliable, awful interface, terrible remote control","I love Apple - I work on an iMac, I have an iPhone, iPod - still, yes! - and I love how everything about Apple products just works seamlessly. That is, with the exception of the ATV.Let's get the remote out of the way. Gorgeous to look at, appalling to use and live with. First up, it's glass, so you end up paranoid about dropping it or bumping it. Apple, in the wisdom, think that less is more - so it is minimalist to the point of being unusable. On/Off button? Nope. Shortcuts to any apps? Nope. And the touchscreen is so sensitive that even thinking about touching it sends you scrolling way past where you wanted to be, often in completely the wrong direction - it's awful.Then there's the user interface. It's cluttered, and confusing, and again, no simple way to just turn it off (go to settings, send it to sleep). It's a mess, and gets wearing trying to navigate to your favourite apps.The sound quality is great BUT the ATV does not like to be told that you don't want to output in Atmos. ""But your amp supports it!"" Yes, ATV, but I don't have an Atmos set up, so 5.1 please. ""Are you sure? I can see Atmos, it's much better."" Just 5.1, please. ""Fine, I'll LIMIT you to 5.1 then, but I'll ask you to change to Atmos occasionally, and if you don't say no I'll just randomly output in Atmos.""Now, this may have just been my bad luck with the reliability of a specific model, but that's all I can go on. In the 2 months I owned it I had to do 5 factory resets due to flashing light. Which then sets off the whole ""no I don't want Siri, no, I don't want Atmos, yes I do want HDR 4.4.4"", which gets tiresome after the second or third time.This thing costs £179. Now, I don't like comparing things at different price points, but the obvious one here is the Amazon Fire TV Cube, currently on sale at £59.99. It does 4K. It does HDR. It does Dolby Atmos, 7.1 surround. It has every app you can think of. And it is a third of the price. And it works, perfectly.Amazon were good enough to offer a refund on the woeful ATV as it was only just 2 months old, and beset with re-booting issues.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on March 26, 2021","Knutsfordchap",269
"Brilliant to use Apple Fitness+ on the TV.","I bought this so I was able to do the Apple Fitness Videos with the bigger TV screen, rather than using my iPad. Works great, connects with my Applewatch. Remote can be used, or virtual remote on the iPhone. Yes you do need Apple tech, as it doesn’t work with Android - but this is what you expect. I really love my Apple TV and although expensive - I am glad I invested in it. We also have a Sony Tv which appears to be losing rights to some apps however most of these work on the Apple device so I’m not losing out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on April 13, 2021","Alicia Mapston",269

"Care about picture quality? This is for you.","I bought this to see how it fared compared to my Amazon FireTV version 2 and NowTV smart box, having been fed up with the limitations of both in some respect or other.To cut to the chase: The Apple TV 4K does Amazon prime video content perfectly. MUCH better than the FireTV box. Amazon should be embarrassed that their own hardware is so badly shown up by a competitor's on **Amazon's own content**! The Amazon FireTV has been irritating me for years with its dropped frames, poor picture quality and inability to match frame rates. The Apple TV 4K blows it away in terms of picture quality and motion. This is probably due to the Apple's native frame rate matching that no other box appears to do (and this is the reason I decided to take a punt on one).On Netflix content: Picture quality is again far superior to the FireTV. Motion is perfect.On BBC iPlayer content: Good picture quality, but there's a MAJOR drawback. See below.Downsides I've found so far:* I HATE the Siri remote. What's wrong with buttons? Trying to fast forward or rewind with the track pad is always a frustrating experience and different technique from app to app. Minimalism gone mad. Oh yeah, it's slippery as an eel and completely the wrong size for my hand so it frequently goes flying across the room - and that's before I fling it from frustration! You can't tell which end is which in the dark. Hard to imagine why they would make such an un-ergonomic object. Good news is that the Apple TV can learn inputs from other remotes so you can use spare buttons from your TV remote for example. I will try to find an old Apple TV remote - one with buttons.* No subtitles possible on BBC iPlayer! What the? Come on BBC. Catch up.* NowTV content: This box is not going to replace my NowTV box. The NowTV app on the AppleTV is rubbish. No wish list is the biggest issue. Picture quality is good, though - as good as with the NowTV box. Frame rate matching doing its job with the 50Hz NowTV content. The NowTV box does iPlayer perfectly so I'll be using it for that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on March 9, 2019","Ben",270

"Ace!!!","Brilliant piece of kit. I’m locked into Apple’s ‘over priced’ land of technology so an Apple TV was an obvious choice. I have an old LCD tv at the moment as I’m waiting for the right deal to come up on a new 75” TV. The Apple TV has turned this Bronze Age tv into a smart tv.Works great with all the smart tech in my house too.

Well, that's correct to a degree.The Apple TV is so much smoother, everything is in one place and it's lighting fast. You get beautiful backgrounds which download daily to display when you're not watching anything on TV.Most of the apps worth well and you have the function of using airplay, meaning that I can play the same song on my Samsung TV and my Bose Soundlink at the same time. The advantage of this is that as I move throughout the house the music flows and follows me. It's great for casting from your phone to the TV and sharing pictures/videos with family members.The sleek Apple TV remote also allowed me to get rid of my TV remote, my freeview box remote and the remote for my soundbar. The Apple TV remote is also able to control my Bose sound system via IR.You also have the benefit of using your iPhone as a TV remoteYes, this isn't for everyone and an iPhone is a must.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on June 28, 2020","Jamie",273

"Superb little box.","I am an avid user of Plex and up to now have been using a HTPC connected to the TV via HDMI. However, Plex announced late last year that they were pulling support on the HTPC version of Plex. So I needed to source an alternative and there seemed to be two options: the Roku box and the Apple TV. I researched this and opted for the Apple TV 4k device not because I have any 4k capability but because the research suggested that the 4k was the most powerful. It was installed in a few minutes but I had one minor (age related) issue where the remote has a number of buttons but the most important and the most used button is hidden within an Apple style track pad. This had me foxed for a few minutes but once I figured it out I was up and running. It took me seconds to install the Plex app and connect it to my Synology server/NAS. I then installed BRITBOX (for which I already had an account). Bottom line - I love this little box. It's a dream to set up and I have all my movies and TV shows on Plex with absolutely no hassle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on February 28, 2020","M. Chambers",273
