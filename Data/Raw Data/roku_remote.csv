"From a value perspective, this might be the best Roku yet...","I'm a long-time Roku user, having purchased devices from every generation throughout Roku's evolution. I've had the very original Roku N1100, Roku 2 XD, Roku 2 XS, Roku 3 (2013 version), Roku 4, a TCL Roku TV, Roku Ultra (2016 version)...and now this Stick +. While I've only had it for a couple of days now, this might be the best Roku I've seen from a value perspective.My house is a Roku house. We have 5 televisions but don't have a cable or satellite subscription.. One of the TV's is a Roku TV and the other 4 all have a Roku attached to them. Literally everything we watch is delivered via the Roku. Our OTA material is delivered from a Tablo DVR to our Rokus. Our local media is served up via a Plex server to the Rokus. We also have PS Vue, Netflix, Amazon video, etc. etc. Bottom line, we use Roku a lot, and I'm very familiar with them. I wouldn't consider myself to be a Roku ""fan boy"", though. While most of the Roku's I've had have been great...there have been some clunkers. The Roku 2XS was a turd that never got any better. The Roku 4 was a turd at the start, but gradually got better with each subsequent firmware update. Unfortunately, the cooling fan in one of my Roku 4s (The 4 was the only Roku model to ever have one) has begun to make the dreaded ""grinding"" noise in recent weeks, so I decided to try replace it with a stick+.I've generally been leery about all of the ""stick"" form-factor devices. They've generally lagged behind the more traditional ""box"" form-factor devices as far as specs go. The Stick+, with its quad-core processor, HEVC support, and 4K capabilities convinced me that the gap may have finally been closed.So, after a couple of days with the Stick+...here are my thoughts on this device- It's snappy and smooth. It's maybe not quite as quick as my Roku Ultras...but it's every bit as fast as the Roku 4.- The new remote is great.The ability to control the TV's power and volume without a second remote or a universal remote is loooong overdue.- Excellent wireless reception. I had two walls between the Stick+ and my router, but was easily streaming 16mbps local media through Plex.- Powering via the TV's USB isn't optimal. Assuming your TV stops providing power to the USB when turned-off, the Stick+ will have to go through the boot-up sequence and then connect to your wireless before you can do anything with it each time you turn on your TV. This can take ~30 seconds. I highly recommend plugging it directly into an outlet using the provided adapter.So, this is a great Roku device. It doesn't have the same bells-and-whistles that my Roku Ultra's have...but then again, I also paid nearly twice as much for those. This Stick+ is much cheaper, provides basically the same UI/playback performance, and also has a remote that will make having to juggle your Roku and TV remotes a thing of the past. That's why I say, absent some deal-breaker that I haven't encountered yet, this is the best dollar-for-dollar Roku yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2017","K.

"Vastly superior to Amazon devices","I purchased the Streaming Stick+ after having repeated difficulties and problems with the Amazon Fire TV Stick. The difference in quality between these two products is astounding. While the Fire TV Stick required constant reboots and had consistently poor network performance, the Roku has been flawless and completely without problems. The addition of 4K support is a huge bonus. I'm especially impressed with the connectivity. My room, where I'm using the device, is on a different floor, on the other side of the house from our router, but I've never had an issue with connectivity or performance.The menu/interface is a little outdated, but I'd gladly sacrifice a flashy menu for good performance. It's astounding to me what a bad product the Fire TV Stick was now that I've switched to Roku. I enjoy the wide selection of channels as well - every streaming service seems to be available through Roku. The voice functionality on the remote works well, and I like that I can turn my TV on and off with the Roku remote as well as adjust the volume. All in all it's an awesome product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2018","Andrew",1
"READ BEFORE BUYING! Great Roku stick and a great price!!","***Quick note before reading numerous reviews! I research everything immensely before I buy it and one HUGE discrepancy I noticed when reading the top reviews for Roku devices is that they mostly date back to 2017-2018 and sometimes even before. Please take into account that THIS Roku is the 2019 release date and THAT is the device you will receive and the device that I purchased & reviewed :). I'm sure what other's wrote is valid for their particular Roku based on the release date but rest assured that a review from 2017 or 2018 can NOT cover a product released in 2019! Hope this proves helpful for anyone considering any streaming device (don't judge the newest model on old model reviews)!A little back story, I do own both Rokus (5 now <U+0001F602>- mostly different generations but my two most recent ones are this one and the Ultra) and Amazon Fire Sticks (2 - various generations) and although I enjoy them all for the fact that we were able to cut our cable about 6 years ago thanks to them, I would say I am thoroughly enjoying this one and the Ultra the most. The technology is the most recent release dates and they stream absolutely flawlessly!I chose to purchase this particular Roku for my father because his bedroom is located on the top floor of our home while our modem is connected in our basement which is a concrete box of internet deadzone (the modem must be connected down there or the internet won't reach the entire house unfortunately, but we are in the process of getting booster Pods from Xfinity). We have the now 300 mb Xfinity internet (aka nerdy gaming speeds - was previously 250 mb) with our router/modem located in our basement for optimum connectivity and a WiFi range extender but our house still has connectivity issues with most devices. This Roku is not only 4K but it's supposed to be exceptionally good for connectivity which played a huge role in choosing this particular one.As soon as I plugged this Roku in, it was love at first home screen just as I had experienced with the Ultra that I had purchased several weeks prior. It recognized all my accounts, downloaded everything quickly, was extremely user friendly and the streaming quality is AMAZING. My father had become all too familiar with the loading screens on various streaming devices and we are ecstatic to be able to say goodbye to them for good thanks to the long-range wireless receiver in this bad boy. The picture quality is always exceptional whether streaming HD, HDR or 4K. This particular Roku stick is also so user friendly that my 70 year father (who generally avoids computers and technology like the plague) can even use it! I also believe this to be the best Roku for it's price point. The Ultra is amazing, but is not necessary in my opinion for most users although it too is highly impressive. We are very pleased with this Roku device and would definitely recommend it.***I took side by side photos of his new Roku (this one - the Roku Streaming Stick+) and his older model, the Roku 3. You can see based off the photos the difference in the remotes, particularly that the newer remote is much skinnier and more comfortable in your hand. The volume controls are the same with the exception of the mute button on the new remote. The Roku 3 remote is also shiny and has different channel buttons compared to the Roku Stick+ remote that is a matte black and features newer streaming channels. The new remote also has the on/off button that most Roku's feature and allows you to easily connect to your tv (it literally auto connects for you) and gives you the power to use your Roku remote on your TV as well. Last note, the picture quality is beautiful even on my Dad's older LG flat screen, but my phone only takes sub par pictures of it so don't mind that <U+0001F602>.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2020","Erin Michelle",1
"Wow Roku! you make other companies look so .... BAD!!!! Thank you!!!!","Original title was: Perfect streaming stick with poor supporting (but mandatory) accessories… however, see updates belowI have bought three units. Two were installed successfully and are working great (with small adjustments described below)!The third one needed to be sent back to Amazon for replacement due to the poor quality and design of its unique power / antenna cable (you can’t find this cable anywhere and it cannot be bought separately). It easily snapped when installed on one of my wall-mounted televisions.In addition, I have a 65-Inch 4K Ultra HD television (Sony XBR-65X900A, a model from 2013) and my single 4K UHD HDCP 2.2 port is placed on the television’s back in an area that cannot fit this stick (due to its size and shape). I needed to add a small flexible extending cord to connect it. Finally, I also got an error message (from Roku) on that same television saying it is not getting enough power from the television’s USB port ... so I had to use the power adaptor that comes with this product. However, the power extender is also a very short cable ...Bottom line, once you get it installed and running (after one week of viewing) the product is great. The sound and picture quality are amazing. I loved the Roku user interface and speedy response. Its only Achilles’ heel is related to its poor proprietary power / antenna cable.UPDATE (November 10, 2017): Amazon quickly replaced the damaged cable and I was contacted by Roku. Roku team provided me with all the help I have needed (well, it should be on its way to me, so I will keep you updated once I'll get it). Thanks a lot Amazon and Roku!UPDATE (November 19, 2017): Today I have opened the door to my beloved FedEx delivery guy and look what I have got from Roku! The three (3) HDMI extenders (as promised) and an additional (and totally new) Roku Streaming Stick+ - all for FREE. Just as a reward for writing this review and adding my comments to it. To remind you, my original review had only four (4) stars (due to the issue with the product's accessory, as described above) – however, now I have updated it to five (5) stars. Because in my book - caring for customers and addressing their needs (and beyond) and making customers feel cared and important – it what makes a company (and its products) prefect. We all know, there are no real perfect products out there. For every product out there, we can always apply our hopes and wishful thinking (""I wish they have added that feature to it"", “I wish the screen was bigger”, ""I wish they have used that my preferred CPU "" and so forth). But a company with a great product and a perfect customer care, how many can you find out there?So, once again - Thank You Roku so much! I really like your product and now admires your service!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2017","ike",1
"Buyer Beware - Please Read This Before You Buy","BUYER BEWARE - I've purchased Roku players in August 2012, May 2015, and this new Stream Stick+ in 2018. When I had a problem ""activating"" my new Streaming Stick+, I was given a number to ""Contact Support Toll Free to Activate Instantly"". I called the number and was told that since I had already registered 2 other Roku devices, in order to Activate this 3rd device, I would need to pay $70.00 to have a PREMIUM account. I told them that I didn't need nor want a PREMIUM account. I asked the customer service rep, to deactivate the first Roku I purchased in 2012 and then I would only have 2 registered devices on my account. I was told that - (1) Even if I deactivated a previous Roku player or (2 )if I opened a new account, I would still have to pay the $70.00 in order to register my Streaming Stick+ .So that is how Roku rewards it's returning long-time customer, by charging them a fee of $70.00 to activate more than 2 of their Roku devices! So, in addition to paying for the device itself, you now have to pay an extra $70.00 to use it!!!I am hoping this review will alert other potential buyers to Roku's new policy of rewarding their repeat customers.Patti","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2018","Patti S",1
"Technical Support holding my Roku device hostage...I am returning it!","We bought this Roku Streaming Stick+ thinking that all we had to do was plug it in and follow instructions. WELL NO! We have a Samsung Smart tv with numerous HDMI slots. We tried ALL of them and the update on the Stick would not load! We kept getting a 005 Network Error. I chatted online with ""Ray"". He stated that I would have to pay Technical support $69 to update the Stick+ . He explained that there have been too many errors updating their products so the company decided that the customer cannot update their new devices on their own and will now have to pay someone to do it for you! NOWHERE in the reviews I read did anyone state that I would be paying an additional $69 to use this device! So here I have a brand new device which costs $65 and now Roku wants to hold that item hostage and render it useless unless I fork over $69 for an update AND oh yes...that $69 would give me 6 months of free tech support! Yay!? Not gonna happen. I will NEVER purchase an item from this company again. They are way out of their league charging for technical support for an update to a brand new device.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2018","Fanofsam1",1
"Switched to Linux mini PC for all in one Fully Functional PC/Video Streamer for TV","EDIT:I switched to a mini PC with Linux on my TV because i was tired of the limitations of Roku and the other popular video streaming devices as they all either have no web browser or a poorly functioning web browser.I use the Linux mini PC with a wireless keyboard with touchpad so I can do anything on my TV.All i had to do was adjust the Display settings in Linux to enlarge the text for TV.Rather than use ""apps"",you just bookmark your favorite websites for video streaming on your web browser.I use the Brave browser which blocks ads.I had been a Roku user for years,including several different models..Here are some points to consider when deciding on which model of Roku to buy:1)If you need to connect by WiFi in a room far away from your WiFi router,I would recommend the Roku Streaming Stick PLUS or Roku Ultra.2)If you have a 4K TV,I would recommend the Roku Ultra or Roku Streaming Stick PLUS.The Premiere 2018 model also plays 4K.3)To search for content using your voice,go with either the Streaming Stick,Streaming Stick PLUS or Ultra.All 3 of these models also have a remote that can control the power and volume on a TV.There is also a Roku app for Android & iPhone/iPad that lets you use your smartphone/tablet to control any Roku device and use your phone/tablet on-screen keyboard for searches.4)If you want a wired ethernet connection,go with the Roku Ultra.5)If you want to connect to an old TV with RCA/Composite audio/video jacks,you will need the Express PLUS6)The Express & Premiere 2018 models have a remote where it has to be pointed at the device,unlike the other Roku models.My gripe about Roku (and other streaming devices) is the lack of a fully functional web browser .I have been surfing the web on the big screen for years and find it ridiculous when an internet connected TV device does not allow you to surf the internet and forces one to switch to yet another internet connected device to do so.I am aware of the screen mirroring function from smartphone/PC/tablet but find that a poor excuse to not include a web browser.Many people who type a lot of messages and/or emails like myself prefer typing on a wireless keyboard rather than a phone/tablet/remote control.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2017","modalsystem",1
"Love the device, dropping Spectrum","Spectrum's move to all-digital was my breaking point with my ever-increasing cable bill. I have six televisions, only two of which were using boxes, and this change would mean that I would have to rent an additional four. I have two Apple TV boxes and one Amazon Firestick, and can say that this is much speedier and more reliable than either of them. I've been trying it out for about a week now, and am confident in dropping Spectrum at the end of this billing cycle.By the way - I see that some reviewers have complaints about customer service trying to charge them for setting up the Roku, or for adding or dropping channels, or for troubleshooting. This is a scam perpetrated by someone with nothing at all to do with Roku. An outside entity was able to create a fake Roku site that topped the list when googling ""Roku."" The phone number you would call if you pulled it from this website was fake and, again, had nothing to do with Roku. Roku was the main victim in this scheme, it's cost them negative feedback all over the internet. Just DON'T google Roku and call any number you find at the site until this is straightened out. Look for a number on the documentation sent with your device. If anyone at the other end of the call tries to charge you for any of these things, you haven't reached the legitimate Roku support guys.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2018","minderbinder",1
"Stopped Working After 5 Months","EARLIER REVIEW: Works just fine* and because our TV is not mounted, the length of the stick is not a problem at all. My husband enjoys the voice command feature and used it occasionally. At some point he was watching the TV and I don't know what he clicked on but the TV started talking--NONSTOP--reading everything on the screen. I was perplexed but, if this happens to you, go into ""Accessibility"" to turn it off. Apparently it's a feature for the sight-impaired.*LATER REVIEW (EDIT): THIS REMOTE IS A POS, It worked for about five months and then stopped working at all. If I hadn't read some other reviews where people had the same problem and discovered they had to change batteries way too frequently--one person had to remove the batteries every night and then put them back in the next night--I wouldn't have known that changing the batteries might work. We put in new batteries and it worked fine . . . for a few days. Then it stopped again.THE COMPANY'S RETURN POLICY IS A JOKE.I wanted to return it but the company has made it sufficiently difficult and iffy to make most people give up on that idea, given the hoops you have to jump through, the resulting length of time it would take to have your TV viewing restored, and the fact that one of the major faults in this remote seems to be that it eats thought batteries. Also, if the remote's problem was its propensity to eat up the charge in your batteries, the company would likely try new batteries and then send it back saying, ""You needed to change the batteries."" So basically we have to eat the price of this thing and take a chance on some other model. Or maybe we'll just get some other system than Roku.RETURN AND WARRANTY SERVICE PROCESS [Sorry about spacing; it was in pdf format]Please access and review Roku Support online help resources at support.roku.com before seeking warranty service.

"Great Product! I have bought multiple , but WARNING!!","The Roku devices are simple and easy to use. I have Roku, Apple TV, and Amazon Fire Stick. I love my Roku Streaming Sticks. These are truly simple to use that my 6yr old kid and 65yr old parents can use them. There are so many steaming app options to use it is great. My one issue is that it never shuts off. Now this might not seem that big of a deal, but if you have a limitation on internet usage, this will eat it right up. I recommend also getting an APC P8GT 8 Outlets Power Strip. This unit has a Parent/Child feature, so once you turn your TV off, the Roku, DVD Player, and another item will also power off until the TV turns back on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2019","Josh Gramlich",2

"Possible Problem: Read this review if you care about data usage...","Read this review if you care about if your ISP limits data use.A little background I am a long time cord cutter, used different devices over the years. Decided to switch due to new service only works on Roku. We use Comcast and have 1TB monthly data limit before fees hit. I also monitor using my routers traffic analyzer to see what is sucking up all my data. After using the Roku Streaming Stick+ for a few days noticed a spike in data use at AM hours and isolated the usage to my new Roku. This version of Roku has a power button to control your TV's power (very handy) Also the Roku can be powered via TV USB or external power supply if your TV's USB ports are too weak. My Roku is plugged into a power supply.**Heres the rub** So by force of habit when I finish watching TV I have been hitting the power button, TV goes off as expected, but the Roku continues to stream the streaming service I was accessing. (disclaimer only tested Prime and PSVUE so far) My router confirmed the damn thing streamed all night long (all night....all night long, dancin in the streets) with the TV off. Also confirmed by just turning the TV off and back on, what ever is being watched is still rolling.**the solution** To date I can't find a setting to time-out based on the Roku nor a method to automatically switch to standby when the TV shuts off without replacing a power strip. So my solution to date is MAKE SURE TO HIT THE HOME BUTTON BEFORE POWERING DOWN THE TV.Other than wasting my internet data it seems like a solid device will post an update if another solution presents itself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2018","S.

"Xfinity Stream Customer is happy!","Bought this Roku as I’m an Xfinity Stream customer. This seems to be the only solution for us that don’t want to watch/stream only on our phones or iPads but also on our TVs. I’m a die hard Amazon Fire TV/Stick customer, but Xfinity only allows their Beta app to be downloaded on Roku.Set up was easy. And I found the Xfinity app in the Roku store easily. From start to finish it took about 6 mins, from booting, to updating, to creating a Roku account, to loading my app and logging in.I like that it comes with the extension cable in case you don’t have a USB port on the back of the TV to power the device. I did splurge with this upgraded version, for 4K, but figured this was a long term investment.Very happy with my purchase!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2018","Midwest Consumer",2
"Watch out for the SCAM!","I like the Roku stick but watch out for the SCAM when trying to activate. Be sure to use your computer and NOT YOUR PHONE. I first tried to activate on my phone and it would not work. It said to not try the code a second time or it could ruin your device. Then there was a phone number to call. Someone with the thickest accent answered and, OF COURSE, wanted more money to set it all up for a ONE TIME FEE. I didn't really understand what he was saying, but I remember another review saying that they wanted to charge $70 to get set up. I didn't even let the guy get that far. I said I wasn't interested in paying for activation that was supposed to be FREE, and said I would be returning the Roku stick and hung up. I then proceeded to try and activate again using my computer and I had NO PROBLEM AT ALL DOING IT BY MYSELF. You do not have to put in any credit card information if you do it this way. I would give the Roku stick 5 stars if there was not this scam out there. Thank God, for the person that posted the review about the EXTRA FEE before I bought mine. I just took the chance to order the stick because my sister has a couple and really loved it. SO, it really does work like it should, but DON'T FALL FOR THE SCAM!!!!!

"Roku supports Charter Spectrum, so I returned my box!","I bought this to replace a cable box which wasn't being used, so I could return the box. I have Charter Spectrum which is supported by Roku. I received my Roku + yesterday and hooked it up to my living room TV to test it out.Setting It up was easy. I have it plugged into my HDMI on the TV and you have a choice of powering it through a USB port on your TV, or using the included wall plug which you plug the USB end into then plug it into an outlet, which I did.Roku takes you step by step setting it up and you do have to put in a credit card, I used PayPal. That's only if you want to watch something that's not free.I loaded the spectrum app, logged into spectrum with my username and password and have all my channels. Live and on demand. I also love the fact that when I use the Spectrum guide with the app, it only shows the channels I'm signed up for, unlike the guide on my DVR box which makes you scroll through all the channels.The remote control has a voice button that you hold down and say what you are looking for, and it takes you to the Roku app with all the results. To test it out I searched Clint Eastwood and so many movies showed up, but most of them needed to be paid for.I was also very impressed with all the movies and shows that Roku offers. Not all are free, but I set up a pin to prevent any unauthorized charges.I can't comment on the range of the wifi yet, but will update once I do.When I read the directions, there was something about using it with a 4k and there's a free adapter they will send, incase something doesn't fit. I went right onto Roku site and ordered it just to have in case I ever need it.I love this so much, I'm seriously considering getting rid of my DVR service and box on my living room TV to save more money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2017","Reezie",2
"Bad WiFi Direct","The Roku Streaming Stick + worked OK, but soon after installing it, other WiFi devices began to get kicked off the network. I noticed in the android WiFI analyzer app that someone had brought up a WiFi access point on the same channel as mine. :( It was also transmitting at a higher power than mine. I soon realized that it was the Roku stick's WiFi Direct connection to its remote. I tried changing my WAP to a different channel, but the Roku followed it there. I tried changing from 2.4 to 5Ghz, but it also followed my access point to the new frequency/channel. I reached out to Roku tech support, and they suggested that I change channels on my WAP...which I'd already done. I informed them that I'd already been down that rabbit hole and they said to try a free HDMI extender? The stick was on a 3 foot extender already. Roku used to have an option in the firmware to try to correct this issue, but they've removed it. I would have given 2 or 3 stars if they'd been more helpful. But as it is, I must highly discourage anyone from purchasing this product until they fix the WiFi design/firmware. I hope they do fix it. If not, I'd probably go for an older Roku model with an infrared remote.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2018","LGE",2

"Best all-around streaming stick","The Roku Streaming Stick+ is simply awesome. It's super easy to set up, it's powered by your TV, and the signal booster that is built in to the USB cable ensures a strong wireless connection. This thing attaches entirely to the backside of your TV and is completely out of sight once it's installed.

"WORST REMOTE EVER!! DO NOT BUY!! AVOID AVOID AVOID!!","Immediately right out of the box I had nothing but problems with the Roku remote: the ""UP"" arrow on the scrolling cross only worked about half the time (it would make the ""ding"" sound when pushed but wouldn't move anything on the screen) which for a streaming device is completely unacceptable. Think about how much time a person spends scrolling through menus! So thinking this was simply a defective remote, I bought another brand new Roku Streaming Stick+ and took the remote out of the box and synced it with my system and guess what? This time the ""Left"" button on the scrolling cross only worked about half the time (again it would make a sound but wouldn't actually do anything on the screen) AND the power button did a ""double tap"" about 75% of the time: If the TV was on and I pushed the power button I would hear two ""clicks"" and the TV would turn off and then turn back on again! Same thing if the TV was off and I hit the power button- I would hear two clicks and the TV would turn on and then turn back off. Again- completely unacceptable.And the worst part about this is that Roku has known that their remotes are cheap and inferior quality and have done NOTHING to fix them! In reading older reviews on Amazon (something I should have done before purchasing) tons of other customers have complained about the low quality of Roku remotes for the last 18 months, and while Roku has commented on a few of these reviews offering only lame platitudes, they have done NOTHING to actually fix the problem.ATTENTION ROKU: It is clear that you're losing thousands of customers due to the shoddy quality of your remote controls...maybe that's something you should address??In the meantime I returned both my Roku Streaming Stick+ and bought the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K and found it is FAR SUPERIOR!!!!! The remote is snappy and works flawlessly, and the interface is also FAR SUPERIOR, so thank you Roku for steering me away from your brand so I could discover that the Fire TV Stick 4K is a much better option.If you're considering purchasing a Roku product, do yourself a favor and read the incredible amount of negative reviews on here BEFORE you make a purchase decision and save yourself the hassle of having to go through what I did with their bottom-tier level, inferior quality junk. (Also note that Roku's ""Customer Service"" is non-responsive and non-helpful).","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2019","Amazon Customer",2
"Best of the best and NO MORE CABLE!","I can't tell you how much I love this Roku compared to Amazon Fire Stick. It is AWESOME and so easy to use and set up. Everything from the packaging to the contents of the box is quality and I love that I don't need 14 remotes to watch streaming tv. Roku even comes with instructions to set it up, but really, it is so simple. You can go online and watch tutorials from Roku and so much more.I had two Fire Sticks and neither one worked with Hulu and the stick got really, really HOT when streaming live tv. I wasn't crazy about the quality of Fire Stick either, Roku is night and day and with so many more features.I read the reviews on Amazon by the guys who I felt really know what they are talking about when it comes to streaming and comparisons. When I read that CNET also recommends this fire stick I was sold, especially after all the problems I had with Fire Stick. I LOVE Amazon and Prime but the Fire Stick was a bust for me in so many ways.I am so glad to be rid of cable and their hideous bills for getting nothing to watch and a ton of aggravation. Optimum raised my basic cable bill $30.00 after 4 years of loyalty and I was DONE!! Streaming is the future and the way to go.I have a 3 yr old Samsung Smart Tv 1080P and this Roku stick works great plus I am ready in the event I decide to get a 4K tv. Don't hesitate a minute. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the Roku sticks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2018","Arlene",3
"I had to pay another $90 (in addition to the cost of the Roku device) to activate it!!!!","I previously had an older Firestick and was having some issues with it so I thought I'd try the Roku. I paid $50 for the Roku stick, thinking that was all I'd have to pay. Boy was I wrong.When I received the Roku and went to set it up, I got to an activation screen that said ""Roku does not charge for activation or support"". However, it then prompted me to go to a website and input a code, which then gave me an error message and directed me to call a phone number.Upon calling this phone number, I was told that I would have to pay a fee of either $90 or $140 to unlock my Roku device. I told the man on the phone that it says right on my screen that ""Roku does not charge for activation or support"". He said that's right, and my device is already activate. However, I can't use it unless I pay this fee.We went round and round, but ultimately I paid the $90 and my device was instantly unlocked. Had I known in advance of this extra charge, I never would have bought the Roku and would have bought another Firestick instead.With the Firestick, you just pay the one time charge and then you can use it. There's no extra ""activation"" or ""unlock"" fee (or whatever word Roku wants to call it). Buyer beware!!","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2020","Jack",3
"Works Great, but becareful of Overheating and Bandwidth use","Been using this for about a week now and overall I am really happy with it, but becareful of overheating and bandwidth use if your ISP is capped (mine is capped to 1.2TB per month which I need for other stuff too besides roku)Because of the overheating I had to add a fan near it and it dropped the temp from 82c to 66c in the secret screen (see pictures)to access the secret screen to see the temp hit this remote key combo:Home, Home, Home, Home, Home, Fast Forward, Pause, Rewind, Pause, Fast ForwardFor the bandwidth control you will want to go into your Router Settings (see last picture) and enable Traffic Management (QoS) and adjust the downstream to just enough for the Resolution you want to stream at, for me I use 1080p, and 3mbps down is just enough for 1080p streaming and I been able to stay around 15 to 20GB a day (0.5 to 0.8GB per hour) (450 to 600GB per month)Another thing you can do to save bandwidth is go into Roku Settings > Privacy > Advertising and check the box on ""Limit Ad Tracking"" and then restart the roku stick to apply the settingHave fun, hope this review was helpful","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2020","Nite",3

It does have a special power cord with a built in antenna, so you cannot a standard USB to Micro USB TV Adapter.

"Roku vs. Amazon","Don't normally write reviews unless they are extraordinarily good or extraordinarily bad. For what it worth, here is a Two-in-One review to illustrate the opposite ends of the spectrum.The Extraordinarily Bad: Roku Customer Service & Technical SupportIn an effort to cut the cord and start streaming, did my research to determine the best content (Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, DirecTV, Youtube TV, etc.) and hardware (Amazon Fire sticks, Apple TV, Google Chromecast, Roku's, etc.) required for the entire family to enjoy. From the hardware perspective, settled on Roku sticks because Youtube TV did not (at the time) support Fire sticks for obvious reasons. Started as a trial with a Roku stick against the some streaming providers listed above, and it worked quite well. So ended up buying a total of 5 Roku streaming sticks (3 to keep and 2 to share) on various occasions in 2018 on Amazon. One of them stopped working after a few months but still was under 1 year warranty. Spent a few days troubleshooting by mixing and matching the configurations of the 3 sticks against 4 different TV sets under 2 different WIFI networks. The results consistently showed that the stick in question (the stick itself and not the remote nor the TVs nor the WIFI networks) worked intermittently for a few minutes then the TV screens went blank.Contacted Roku as follow:1. Logged a ticket on Roku website indicating the problem as such. No response for several days until after calling them in next step.2. Called technical support explaining the problem and the troubleshooting process above. They said they'll send an HDMI extender.3. Received the extender 2 weeks later, but it did not work at all - no audio, no video, just blank screen. The problem was actually worst since using the stick without the extender would at least work for a few minutes then stopped.4. Called them the following day. They admitted that they had sent a bad part and will make sure to send a ""working"" HDMI extender. It never arrived. Probably never send it.5. After 2 weeks of waiting, called them again and explained the troubleshooting process all over again (for the 4th time). They said they will send a remote. With patience running thin, asked the tech support rep why would she send a remote when the stick is the problem. After a brief silence, she asked to wait for a few minutes then came back and said an email with instructions on how to return the stick for a replacement will be sent.6. Three days later, still no email. And no, it's not in spam folder. Simply put - they lied the second time. Frustrated but decided to give them a final chance to rectify the problem and called one last time. After 25 minutes, a rep finally answered then the line got cut off immediately. Coincidence?Bottom line: The problem had been reported for over a month and still no resolutions. The average wait time for each call is 30+ minutes due to the so called ""heavy call volume"". They sent bad part and lied their way out of honoring their warranty.The Extraordinarily Good: Amazon Customer ServiceFrustrated and planned to just throw away the stick, but also decided to give Amazon a call to inform the type of service Roku had provided with the hope that if this is the norm, Amazon will think twice before selling Roku products on its site. The Amazon CS rep apologized, offered a refund, and will work with Roku on the issue. Didn't expect that! After all, this is a Roku's problem not Amazon's. The call took less than 5 minutes. Problem solved. Thank you Amazon. This is another reason for being a Prime member.In the streaming war against giants like Amazon, Google, Apple, Disney, etc. and with the type of service Roku had provided, good luck Roku. For your survival in this crowded space, you (Roku) should take a page out of Amazon's playbook and learn from it. Otherwise, you will be crushed like a cockroach that you are.Update:Finally received the Warranty Swap email from Roku four days after the call in step 5 above (a few hours after posting this review). Decided to ignore it as so much time had already been wasted. It's unfortunate that the device worked quite well (when and if it worked), but the customer service is unbearable.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2019","Amazon Customer",3
"Failed at 3 months; neither Apple nor Roku provided useful assistance","Streaming stick was great at start - hooked up easily and worked well; good picture and sound. Good remote that also handled TV power and sound volume.However, one day it just failed - wouldn't connect to WiFi. A WiFi network with other devices and with the main hub just two feet from the Roku. Signal quality was very high and speed tests on WiFi were strong (100Mb)Text to Amazon ""Get Product Support"" got a quick, polite chat started. All the usual ideas: reboot, repower, reconnect, reset, redo password. After 10 minutes, the advice was to contact Roku.Roku site was a set of videos on setup.

"Junk. Already malfunctioning after 4 months.","Extremely disappointed with this product. I have owned it for 4 months. About a month ago it began malfunctioning. Periodically the unit will turn on, work for about 30 seconds, then simply go dead. Usually when this happens it will occur at least two times in a row. I called support and their solution was to plug it into a different HDMI port. This did not solve the problem. So I have to make another call to hopefully get a 4 month old unit replaced because it is defective. Also, the remote drains the batteries every 3 weeks. I should have purchased a fire tv stick.

"ROKU IS A SCAM!","My first Roku I bought about a year ago. It just went out on me so I ordered a new 49.00 from amazon. When I went to set up on my Tv it gave an activation code and an error code when I tried to activate. A phone number popped up and I called it and it sounded like India. They said that there was a one time software update charge of 29.95 for her to activate my new device! And I would never have to do that again! I said absolutely not and took her name Tanya at Digistream I’m Tampa Fl. Nothing in advertising about extra charges to activate! So I decided to get Roku customer service 816 272 8106. No longer working due to Covid! So I attempted to activate my device on tv again and this time I got someone who said they could activate but as of June they have to register new customers and it’s 200.00 for a year and 450.00 for 5 years!! I told her I’m returning this because it’s a scam and Roku is letting this happen. There is no customer support! DoNT BUY! This just happened to me on July 16 2020.

"It can replace your cable box!","I purchased the Roku Streaming Stick+ for two reasons:1. To attach it to my TV that is not a smart TV. Without built-in streaming apps or W-Fi capability, my TV needed a streaming device to view alternate programming.2. To replace an Infinity cable box that I've been paying a monthly rental fee to use.I read the descriptions and customer reviews of multiple Roku devices to find one that might meet my goals at a reasonable price. This device really fits the bill. I ran it through testing before disconnecting the cable box. I can still see all of the Xfinity channels in my package (I was skeptical about this). I had to get used to a different menu and user interface, but most of the features are available including recording, searching, and voice commands. One thing that is missing vs. the Xfinity remote is that the Roku remote does not have an Info button to see program descriptions.The picture quality is excellent. Once a link is established the Roku remote can be used to power on the TV, but there is a slight delay in response time compared to the Xfinity remote or the TV's manufacturer's remote.If you select this model you should add a USB extension cable to your order: You'll be glad that you did. The USB extension cable provided in the box is too short unless your TV is within two feet of the wall socket.All in all, I recommend this product. I will be sending in the Xfinity cable box to lower my monthly bill.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2020","S. Prince",3
"So much better than Firestick","We replaced our Firestick with one of these and we won't ever be going back. In the past few years, we've been through multiple Firesticks as they seem to only last a year or two for us before having problems and just failing. We would have connection issues constantly, dropping connection or just taking forever to load. Super slow loading of some apps, especially Amazon's own store (which doesn't make sense.. you'd think their product would load their own app quickly).Roku doesn't have any of these issues and the pre-programmed buttons on the front are great for us. Great streaming quality, never has slow load times, never lags, quickly cycles through applications and is a very smooth experience. The remote also controls turning our TV on/off and can control the volume. A really great, simple product that does exactly what it's meant to do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2020","Chris",3
"Good device, Defective Remote","This is my second Roku in the house. I bought this Streaming Stick + because of the flawless performance of my wired Roku device.My problem with the Streaming Stick + is the Remote and it's inability to pair. After reading all the support pages and doing shutdowns, resets and fresh batteries it started to pair but then would stop responding. The remote has some kind of a power problem and does not recognize the battery strength. Half way through configuring the Roku the battery icon appears and shows ""no power"". At that point the process stops.To prove it's the remote and not the device I paired my older remote with the Streaming Stick and it paired and configured properly and connected to my streaming accounts.Roku support first instructed me to contact Amazon for a new remote. My response was ""Really? Amazon doesn't carry components within a product they sell. I would have to return the product.""

"They try to trick you into giving your credit card, but it isn't necessary.","I've never had a Roku before. This is well priced for what you get and the streaming is good quality. There are a few big caveats, though.The first is that Roku try to trick you into putting in a credit card. As you first sign up, the interface gives you no option to avoid this (!), but it actually isn't necessary to function. You have to stop your registration at the point they ask and restart the roku. Then, just log into the website. Works fine without the CC. I guess marketing thought it was a good idea to force customers to give payment info. It is kind of scummy.The second is that search is lousy. Search within individual channels is awkward, and the main Roku search interface doesn't differentiate between movies on channels you already have, and movies on new channels they want you to subscribe to. By mixing them all, they try to force you to sign up for more channels, I suppose, but it is at the cost of a easy to use search function.The third is that there is no general history or resume. If you stop in the middle of a movie there is no indication when you turn the machine back on of what you were watching or where you stopped. You have to remember to go back into whatever channel you were in, and look for the specific movie again. Remembering current status is basic functionality, and the whole thing is made worse if you have more channels as Roku encourages. Surely Roku could figure out how to resume properly. I purchased this for my elderly parents, all this lack of basic function makes their lives considerably more complicated. It is a shame, since those things would be so easy to do right and the streaming itself is fabulous.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2020","matteo",4
"A GREAT Roku, Follow directions and you won’t get scammed...","Let me preface this with I have owned every single Roku since the initial model (over a decade ago now). Roku as a platform has grown exponentially since then, and I am proud to use them on all of my TVs. This Roku stick is almost indistinguishable from its full size counter part in terms of speed and quality. I went with the stick form because it was for a projector and I did not want to run another HDMI cable through the ceiling.For those who are posting about a scam or being held “hostage” by support, make sure you actually go to Roku’s website, and check the SSL certificate. (This is why we don’t google URLs when they’re presented to you on the screen...). Roku does not force any fee to activate and they don’t cap the number of devices (they don’t even require a payment method on file to use, unlike another streaming stick I know). If you were told otherwise, you were made a fool of by a scammer who took advantage of you not checking the URL.The new remote with this stick is so light and thin, a major improvement over the older generations! My only complaint is that the library of remote commands (TV power, volume and mute) is restricted to TVs- not AVRs and Projectors. You can usually google it and find a brand that uses the same code to map it to get it to work- just not as simple.While I’m a firm believer in always wiring streaming devices to your network (I.e. Ethernet port), this stick does a great job streaming 4K over WiFi regardless of the fact that it’s in a terrible spot for WiFi coverage (behind a projector with a lot of interference and hanging off the ceiling).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2021","ktsharples",4
"Doesn't work with Android/Pixel 2 XL. Customer Service is TERRIBLE","I bought a few of these, cause we had tried all the media streamers and this one seemed to work the best of all of them. Unfortunately if you use android (like millions of others do) Roku is only focused on iOS users. The app is the only way to type on the screen that isnt the god-awful cursor based ""hunt and peck"".Well, search doesn't work on android and when I chatted with support, they just told me to use ios or to wait for possible further updates to see if that fixes my experience..THEN THEY JUST DISCONNECTED. I tried contacting them back and they would read my previous transcript and immediately disconnect from me. I wasn't rude or abrasive or anything. they're simply finished trying to help I guess... I tried talking to a supervisor ""Escel"" and he too would disconnect form me after saying hes reviewing my previous chat.I went to roku.com to get their phone number for support, but it was country code +44 (UK), and international calls cost big $, so Im stuck with chat.So I'm simply returning their half-baked sticks.

"Wish I bought 2 vs Expensive Ultra","I returned the Roku Streaming Stick+ that I bought in 2018 because it would not connect. This 2020 Roku Streaming Stick+ connected to my dumb TV quickly, and the wi-fi is fast. The included wi-fi extended might be the difference. I am not seeing the lag that I noticed with the Roku Ultra over wi-fi. I also got three months of CBS All Access commercial free to binge Picard etc.. The Ultra draw was that I could connect it to the ethernet and improve my signal, future proof the device with options such as an SD card, and have a headphone jack backup to my Bluetooth earbuds. However, the streaming stick cost, speedy operation, and CBS deal beats the Ultra advantages.The only problem that I have had so far is that YouTube would not connect to the profile I wanted, leading me to delete an obsolete profile that used the same e-mail address.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2020","Kam",4
"BEST AMAZON PURCHASE EVER","I got this streaming stick+ today in the mail. It was very easy to setup. I did need to use a web browser on my laptop to make a Roku account. You just plus the streaming stick into an HDMI port and then you either plug the USB back into the TV or use the included extender and USB adapter to plug it into an outlet. This supposedly offers a better experience.It seems as though this stick would be very protable for travel or overnight visits. There is no box that will inevitably get dusty lol. If you travel a lot and would like to bring along your streaming services, this streaming stick is perfect.My favorite part is the amount of channels available to add to your Roku home screen. There are also so many apps that offer movies and TV shows free of charge and without subscriptions. I spent like two hours adding and checking out different channels lol. There are even many options for sports, kids, news, and weather. There's live TV, and also the popular streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, etc. I personally like just having Youtube so I can watch my Google Play purchased movies and TV. I'm also looking forward to watching the Crashcourse playlists on Youtube to help with my college classes.So far I am very impressed with this purchase!

"AWESOME PRODUCT","I live in the country and typically my available internet speed is less than 5 MBPS. Sometimes only 2 MBPS. But I took a chance and tried the ROKU streaming stick. The developers must have fouled up because it was so intuitive and so easy to get it up and running I figured they must have made a mistake. ! Less than 8 minutes to go operational right out of the box. It enhances the picture with the Dolby Vision where blues are bluer and golds are more golden,etc. The voice search feature is almost without fail. In fact, it has not ever failed to understand me, or my 94 year old Mother ( oh yeah, I bought one for her too. ) It's that good. I bought this on sale at Amazon for 30.00 and free shipping. I had NO IDEA there would be so many free channels. It basically has opened up the world. I had been trying for YEARS to get the Smithsonian channel and even once tried to trade 40 channels for it without success. Now I can watch it on one of the ROKU free channel options. Incredible. Buffering. Maybe every once in the course of a show it MAY buffer once but only for a few seconds but typically so far it runs as if it were recorded. The satellite company went from $56 to $72 and then to $92 dollars a month and I tried to negotiate with them but was unsuccessful. Glad I couldn't . Now, I have probably three times as many channels and it is virtually free. I'm saving close to $100 dollars a month. You may even do better because as far as I know EVERYONE has faster download speeds than I do. Hope this helps with your decision making. ps the unit that I purchased I found out was the 2019 version. They make a 2021 version which is probably the one to buy.

"BEWARE: Does not work on older TV's !!!! Get Roku Express instead.","It pains me to give a bad review to Roku because I have another Roku TV and I love it! This is not a ding on the product itself, but more on the product page. The product page neglects to explain the importance of HDCP 2.2 standard. It is some sort of copyright protection technology so that you can't make recordings of 4k HDR streams. Older TV's that are only 1080p compliant (basically anything older that 2013-ish) won't have the proper copyright ability and the Roku device won't work with it AT ALL. I wish that it was more explicitly explained in the product page that if you want Roku on an older 1080p TV, you have to buy the ROKU EXPRESS device, instead. I had a very bad experience trying to get this to work on my non-smart TV. After several hours searching the internet, i finally learned of the problem. I knew that my TV was not 4K, but I just thought that the steaming stick would just dumb down the quality for my TV.

"So much better!","Honestly do yourself a favor and ditch all the other streaming sticks for this one!I’ve used an Amazon fire stick for years.

But when I would do stuff on my laptop/phone everything loaded perfect.

"Remote has pairing issues. God help you if you have multiple WiFi networks around you","Got a new one yesterday and plugged it into my TV. Completed the initial setup steps like Language selection , Remote pairing and Wifi selection. The stick said it needed a software update and will reboot. Post the reboot, the stick would flash the initial startup logo and then just shutdown..Extremely disappointed with the purchase . Wish Roku had better QC in place.FINAL UPDATE 5/15/2019: Roku Support want me to ship this rubbish remote to them at my own cost and they will send a replacement. What these ‘experts’ don’t seem to realize that the problem is inherent to the product and no amount of replacements is going to solve it. Maybe they should just look at Amazon reviews to see how many customers have had the same problem.UPDATE 12/12: I returned the stick for a replacement and had my fingers crossed hoping that this would just work but looks like Roku had other plans. The stick works (phew!) but the remote doesn't want to pair unless your 2 feet from the TV , which Roku should know, defeats the purpose of a remote control.UPDATE 12/18: Got in touch with Amazon who were wonderful in contacting Roku and ensuring that I got a replacement remote.Sadly the replacement remote worked fine the first day and had the same problem day two onwards.UPDATE 4/6 - Multiple follow ups with Roku tech support has gone no where. Roku support keeps insisting I try and change the Wifi channel (non tech savy folks , if you are reading this, you should avoid this stick) and select one that is not congested. I tried doing that but the funny part is the Roku won't connect to those free channels (thanks for nothing Roku support!).I believe the product has inherent flaws which should have been fixed before the product was rolled out.The remote definitely has pairing issues , something which was not there in the older stick. Roku should acknowledge and fix this problem instead of sending replacement remotes.I really have lost all confidence in Roku now and will NOT buy anything from them ever again.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2018","ZethuZ",5
"Great - BUT BEWARE THE SCAM!","Luckily the scam I'm talking about is in no way Roku's fault. When setting up my Roku I attempted to pull the Roku site on my phone and punch in the code. Apparently there's either a REALLY good spoof website, or the actual one is somewhat infiltrated, because I got a message that my Roku was ""temporarily locked"" and that I needed to call them. I've set up a few of these devices before, so I was already on alert. I called the number and was set up with ""Roku customer service"" who offered to fix the device and get me started, but said they'd need to charge me a one-time fee to access over 50 Roku channels. If you've used Roku before you know this is not the case. We went back and forth a bit. The Roku setup screen even states that there is no fee to set up. I asked the ""technician"" about this, and they gave some excuse about how charging me money to activate me was not an ""activation"" fee. I was getting more suspicious, and requested a supervisor, which I'm not sure wasn't the same person. The ""supervisor"" offered me a ""supervisor's discount"" of $10. It's interesting to note that the base activation fee kept changing from $49 to $69. I eventually got very suspicious, told them I was investigating further, and hung up on them. I then went my desktop computer upstairs (which I was too lazy to do before) and activated the Roku that way, and was streaming in a matter of minutes.I Googled it later, and apparently it's a fairly common scam. Don't believe me? Look for yourself.Roku makes a wonderful product. My original ones are still running okay, but I've been upgrading a bit this year. I've been consistently happy with their performance. I highly recommend them. Just be careful when you go to register.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2020","Termitesforhire",5
"Cheap 4K streaming and a very good remote that turns your TV on/off and adjusts TV volume.","I owned a previous-generation Roku and needed to add a couple more as we moved from cable to streaming via SlingTV. I was skeptical of the stick, thinking it would be slow and limited. But I've had these now for almost a year and they are great. This is the 2017 version of the Roku Streaming Stick (the + indicates it supports 4K video.) It's a good device, and this and its non + twin both feature a wonderful remote control that can turn your TV off or on -- and adjust the volume. This means that most of the time you'll only need one remote control -- a great feature. You also get voice commands.If you haven't used streaming video before, you may be confused by the options such as Roku, Amazon's Fire, Google's Chromecast and Android TV, and Apple TV. You choose a device and then there are available apps for various pay- and free streaming services. Services such as SlingTV, youtube TV, Direct TV Now, Hulu Live, and Playstation Vue all provide selections of cable and broadcast channels live -- basically cable without the cable. There are literally hundreds of other free services on Roku, with wide ranges of content AND quality.Having used this product for the better part of a year, I can easily recommend it, unless you need a hard-wired solution such as the Roku Ultra.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2018","S.

"Great for watching Netflix and Youtube, much better than Apple TV","I mainly got this for watching Netflix since my TV can no longer connect to the internet on its own. I also started pairing it with my phone to watch YouTube videos - and I LOVE the fact that unlike AirPlay (with Apple TV), I don't have to stay on YouTube on my phone to continue watching YouTube on the TV - I can even call or use other apps, and even quit the YouTube app on my phone and videos will still play!Not to mention, the remote has more than 5 buttons (unlike the Apple TV remote), including a handy volume button and a Netflix button, which automatically takes me to Netflix, even if the TV isn't on! Love these little features.However, after a few days, I was no longer able to connect/share my iPhone or MacBook screen to the TV/Roku Stick. The Roku Streaming option stopped appearing under ""Connect to"" menu. I'm only able to connect my phone to the TV when playing YouTube, since YouTube always has a cast option at the top and still lists Roku Streaming as available to connect.If you experience this issue as well, I recommend downloading the WebCaster app - you can paste the link of websites (other than YouTube) into the app and the option to stream it on your Roku TV will appear.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2021","Michele",5
"Arrived Same Day - Working Perfectly!","Interested in ""cutting the cord"", I researched the best streaming devices, and found that the Roku Streaming Stick+ was consistently in the top 5 and was the best value for the money for our particular family. I was able to choose same-day delivery, and received them in the late afternoon. They were contained in a larger box, so no one could see what was in the package, and the delivery person thoughtfully put them behind a half-wall in our entry court, rather than right in front of the door where they could be seen from the street, which I appreciated!When removed from the box, the items were just as described, in unopened, original packaging. The quick start guide takes you step-by-step through attaching the Roku to your TV and syncing it to the remote, and from that point on, you simply follow the on-screen directions as it walks you through setting up your Roku account (free - but keep in mind that you will need a laptop, desk computer, or phone present in order to access the Roku website to do this), linking your device to it, and starting to use it. It was easy to add the streaming services we already had, such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, and interesting to browse the many free options available and add the ones we wanted - the Western TV & Movie Classics"" channel is a big hit with my husband and his dad. Once set up, there are links on the home page to a ""Getting Started"" with Roku page, and a ""Tips and Tricks"" to Using Roku page for more information regarding your Roku, in addition to tiles for whatever channels you chose during your set-up.We have been using these (we installed two in our home, and one in my 90-year-old father-in-law's home) for a month now, and have had no issues whatsoever. We have not had any problems with lag, and pictures are clear and bright (any fuzziness in the photos I've provided are the fault of the camera operator!). The user interface is pretty standard for this type of thing - the biggest learning curve we faced was figuring out exactly which apps the shows we normally watched were on. However, between being able to customize which streaming apps appear on your home page, and the two ways to search - you can either type in the name in the search bar, or you can hold down a microphone-iconed button on the remote and, for example, say ""Search Criminal Minds"", it is fairly easy to get to where you want to be without having to flounder around in the interface. Even dad-in-law, who is somewhat electronically challenged, got the hang of it fairly quickly, and is very comfortable with using the interface at this point. We are all very happy with the device and service. Highly recommended!NOTE: Regarding the stick being at the side of the TV in our photo, in case anyone is concerned about the aesthetics of having this sticking out of your TV - there were other HDMI ports we could have used at the back of the TV, where the stick would have been hidden and only the Roku power cord coming down next to the TV power cord would have been visible. However, these were difficult for me to reach, and since my husband is not very technologically savvy, I am the one who usually deals with the electronics and troubleshoots when there are problems, so I was more concerned with the device being easily accessible that I was about how it looked. Rest assured, if you want a neater look, it is certainly available if you choose to use an HDMI port at the back of your TV. :- )","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2019","Catherine A.

"So glad that we upgrade to a newer version of a Roku Stick","My family has owned 2 other Roku Sticks and have gotten a huge amount of use out of each one. One of the sticks we use everyday, many hours a day, with our streaming service, making the roku stick is our primary way of watching TV. By and large, the sticks have worked really well for many years.But recently, as the quality/quantity of TV streaming increased, we found that having a Roku stick that was quite a few years old, wasn't performing as well as would like. It still worked, but we found it dragged when trying to search or trying to scroll through the, seemingly, hundreds of channels/options that are available.So, it was time for an upgrade. We choose the Streaming Stick Plus and, after using for a few months now, we wish we had upgraded far sooner.The new stick is easily able to handle the demands that streaming puts on it . Each channel we choose comes up much faster than with the old sticks. I think, though i don't know i can prove it, that the new stick is able to receive/utilize a stronger wifi signal, especially as compared to the older model.The on-screens controls that come with the newer, upgraded version of the roku are much easier to use. the new remote, with built-in controls to turn the tv on/off, to control the volume of the tv and to mute the volume of the tv means that having a seperate, tv only, remote isn't needed.And, we've have not only been having fun using the voice controls on the remote, we've found the voice controls to be an extremely helpful shortcut for many different sites.I haven't yet tried hooking the roku up to Alexa, as that isn't a major plus for me, but I might try doing that in the future.so now i'm thinking that it might be a good time to go ahead and upgrade that one remaining, older roku that we have. yep, that sounds like a good idea to me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2020","Shakey Town",5
"Better than expected!","I've being using the Amazon Firestick for a year without any complaints. When needed to buy a second streaming unit, Amazon wouldn't send theirs to a forwarding address. This forced me to buy a different brand: Roku.At the beginning I wasn't happy (resistance to change) but as soon as I started using it all I could say is: WOW!! THIS IS GOOD!Roku is very fast and responsive. The interface can be customized and I believe it is better. I get exactly the same functionality as before, but with a faster response time. I love the fact the the Roku controller can turn on/off the TV and control the volume; makes streaming a bit easier. When the cell is used as a controller, the sound can be heard through earbuds without any noticeable lag.I'm very happy with this streaming stick. Roku is highly recommended, and will never go back.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2020","Maximo Ortiz",5
"A Fantastic Little Device","I happen to get my first ROKU about a year back at Home Depot. It sat on the shelf for 6 months until I was at a location with high speed internet before I attempted to use it but since then, I have grown to use it with more and more appreciation each time.The first thing I did was to sign up for CBS All Access ($10US/mo) and I had Amazon Prime. The picture quality is definitely HD and as good or better than satellite HD with the upside that so many ""channels"" are available of my own choosing. There is a lot of free material available outside any subscriptions and beside the subscriptions, there is one-time buy offered on those things you really want. There is no charge for ROKU services and ROKU bills any charges through the provider you choose (simple set-up for each). After that, it's just like punching into a channel. On top of that, the ROKU Streaming Stick + offers voice recognition so you can search for things using voice prompts and ROKU is very good at it (actually excellent). If an old movie (or other video content) is available, ROKU can find it using a voice prompt. YouTube works the same way and voice prompting saves a lot of typed in requests for searching. I had very rare glitches on a 1.5MB/s internet connection, and none on my home 3MB/s service (though not using any other device at the time) - just rock-solid video and audio.In summary, I would recommend this item to anyone interested in streaming programming and feel it is a great deal for the low cost it is offered at.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2020","Robert D.",5
"Roku's are great","I've had several Roku's and the stick is the best so far. It typically streams very well, but streaming isn't flawless. Having said that, I cannot confirm that it is a Roku issue. We are on GigaBit service, but it is not perfect. Hulu isn't perfect and we're pretty sure the service has gone down for a few minutes, but it's rare. Netflix occasionally doesn't stream, but by the time we check using another device the Roku is streaming again, so it tough to tell. There are a lot of variables. The Roku stick seems to be more reliable than earlier Roku devices, but still has moments of confusion and it self-reboots, but it seems like this happens less than once a month and it's only down a minute or so. When we had cable, it went out more often and for longer periods. Never had a dish, but friends who do complain about it not working and not available in every room.Yes, if you don't want to move the stick from room to room and reboot it, every TV has to have one, but our cable company made us have a box on every TV and they charged us rent for them every month (3 months was about the cost of a Roku stick). Some TVs now have apps built in, but the Roku allows us to add (and remove) channels and services our TV didn't come with and keeps them all in one easy place.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2020","JAS",6
"Extraordinary!","I have owned this unbelievable piece of technology for about 10 days so please give my review the weight you deem appropriate. So far, I only have two complaints. The mute button on the remote is poorly located and too easily accidentally pressed and occasionally the remote is a little sluggish in responding. Easily connected, setup and activated, the device provides a mind-numbing number and variety of apps and channels with excellent picture and audio. For those who choose to connect directly to av receivers I recommend you set the device audio to Dolby Digital plus. You will then enjoy multi-channel sound where available. You may also need an hdmi extension cable. Although Roku will send one free of charge upon request it’s only about 4 inches long and practically useless. Amazon sells several and I purchased a 6ft one from UGreen that works perfectly. I power my stick from a USB jack on the TV. Roku recommends using the supplied adapter and connecting to an electric socket so it remains powered on at all times eliminating start up delay. However, it only takes a few seconds to power on from the USB connection and this method also eliminates any heat build-up (however marginal) when the TV is off. Some may argue that having the unit fire up every time the TV is turned on is likely to reduce longevity. Of course this is the same argument advanced for computers and some other electronic devices. I’ll leave that choice to you after noting that heat is a nemesis of electronic devices of virtually all kinds. Use the power option that works for you. Once set up you can literally spend hours just surfing through the staggering number of apps and channels. Absolutely amazing device. I’ll follow up if my opinion changes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2020","Jim Bob Jones",6
"Roku FINALLY fixed its 4K problems","I have had a bad history with 4K Roku devices. With my new 4K system I tried to use first the Premiere+, then the Ultra, and finally the Streaming Stick+, all played through the A/V receiver in my living room's 7.2 system. All three devices failed with HDCP 2.2 errors. Despite the fact that all components in my new system were 2.2 compatible, the Rokus would stop the entire system because its software apparently imagined that I had a recording device attached to my receiver. A Stick+ plugged directly into the 4K TV in my bedroom worked fine.I last sent Roku an email about the problem in April 2018. I had long since returned all the devices to Amazon for credit. Then in February 2019, ten months later, I received an email from Roku stating that the software problem had been corrected and that I should be able to use 4K devices. I decided to give it one last chance and bought a Stick+ for the living room. I've had it for about a week and it seems to be working fine.I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because (a) it took Roku TEN MONTHS to fix this problem and I don't imagine that I'm the only person who experienced it and (b) they put these devices on the market before they were functioning properly.Not everyone plugs their devices directly into their TV, and Roku should have an effective way to correct problems in a timely fashion. None of the other 2.2 compatible devices I have has ever had any 2.2 problems.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2018","Detroit Mike",6
"Roku stick helps you cut your satellite/cable tv bill!","Never used a Roku stick before but I wanted to cut cable. It was insanely easy to install and setup. A keyboard definitely would make the sign in process easier but I was able to proceed anyways.I didn’t like that you have to think about what you want to watch. With cable you flip it on and find something interesting. I have gotten used to it though and have found some really great shows on Hulu. Nothing is Live. If I want Live the Hulu Live is an additional 54.99 per month. If I want News I guess Pluto is the way to go. With the Roku stick and streaming you can definitely binge on specific shows. In fact I over binged as I didn’t know how to change channels at first ( top arrow to left pulls up guide )Unfortunately I was unable to cut my cable completely. I added spectrum TV. I love love love it. I had direct TV prior and was paying about $300 per month for internet plus satellite tv. Crazy! With the roku stick on 2 of my TVs ... I have A spectrum DVR and cable on the main tv ( instant tv:)) and the spectrum tv app on the other 2.( a 4th tv has the Xbox one which can download the spectrum app). I still have Hulu for $5 a month . My total now is about $200. The Roku sticks have definitely helped me cut down on my tv entertainment bills. They are really easy to use for someone who isn’t tech savvy. They are portable since you create a Roku account ( free) and plug them into the hdmi spot on The TV. You can either plug them into a wall outlet or the usb tv port for power. They also act as the digital box you need to rent from your cable company if your TV isn’t smart.I feel that the Roku stick has allowed me to get closer to my goal of cutting cable completely. They are definitely user friendly:) Five stars Roku!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2020","Wolf",6
"No need for power adapter","Having read too many comments that the USB power would not work, I was skeptical. But it works. One less power cable. Actually, why would not? I think all TV sets' USB ports are power USB anyway. Surprisingly, such a tiny device. I tried all other streamers with Android TV. Preferred Roku for 1. powered USB and 2. interface. I think the latter wins over the others for very clean design, not cluttered as others. Like Roku channel with Live news. I thinks it's much cleaner interface and easier to navigate than Peacock.What I don't get it is why this piece of fabric on the remote with the logo. What's the point? I think it even makes the production more expensive. Why not to stamp the Roku logo on the remote itself? There is a lot of room for those four letters. Also, I wish the volume controls were on top of the remote, not on the side. But it's survivable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2021","Yuri Budnyatsky",6
"Buyer Beware: Poor Customer Support","I bought this Roku Streaming Stick+ in October 2018 to replace my old FireStick which was really slow and old and frustrating to use because it would suddenly stop in the middle of a show and go back to the home page.The Roku was easy to set up, and worked great for a couple of months. In December we had the first problem: it wouldn't work: just showed a bad picture with zigzagging lines. We reset it and couldn't get the picture to show up at the right size: it was enormous. Called tech support, and the guy helped us fix that problem. Then another problem presented: no audio and Roku remote won't control TV. I don't remember what I did to fix it, but it started working again. Good deal.We were gone for a week during the holidays. Came back and the Roku worked fine up until 2 weeks ago. Same problem as before. My husband was home, and he did what the technician had us do the first time: reset the unit and start over with setup. All good, but now the audio is not coming through again and we can't control the TV with the Roku remote. I couldn't remember what I did to fix it, so I called tech support. The guy had us try several things to get the remote to work and the sound to come through, but nothing worked. He said he could replace the unit, but we would have to return the one we have before they would send out the new one, and that I would get an email explaining how to ship it back and where to ship it. A day or two later, I got an email telling me that my case was ""under review."" Then I got another couple of emails asking me how they had done!

"Resolution upgrade AND it connects to new TV through AV receiver","This is my fourth Roku (the oldest one finally died after many (8?) years, and this one is an upgrade from a conventional 1080 Roku Stick). Didn't have any of the problems with registration highlighted by another reviewer. My old Roku Stick connected just fine through the streaming box HDMI input of my Onkyo 4K capable AV receiver to my old Sharp 1080 TV, but when I upgraded to a Samsung 4K TV, the new TV didn't recognize the video signal from the old Roku Stick when it passed through the AV receiver. (Note: the old Stick worked fine connected directly to a HDMI port on the new TV). Anyway, I decided to get a 4K Roku Stick+ to match the resolution of the new TV. As a bonus, the Stick+ works fine passing the video signal through the AV receiver to the new TV. Unfortunately, with this configuration, the Stick+ remote control does NOT control the TV power and volume (no surprise there), but I'm confident it would work if I connected the Stick+ directly to a HDMI port on the new TV. However, in my set-up, the TV is wall-mounted so it's ""cleaner"" to use the AV receiver as the ""command center"" for all the HDMI video inputs by placing peripherals (AV receiver, blu-ray, boxes, etc.) on an adjacent shelf/table and use a single cable from the AV receiver to send the selected video signal to the TV.Bottom line, the Roku Stick+ provides an upgrade in video resolution to match my new TV, and also solves the problem of passing the Roku video signal through the AV receiver to the TV. 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2019","Kent Sowers",6

"Nice device","I purchased the Roku Streaming Stick in 2016 and was happy with it. The Streaming Stick+ is an improved version with voice recognition that works well and the added TV controls to the remote is a handy new feature.The Stick+ is connected to a 2014 Sony 1080p TV. Set up was quick and easy. What's particularly nice about the Stick+ is that it stays hidden behind the TV so there's no additional clutter. Using the 5 GHz band, streaming quality is excellent with great picture and no issues with buffering. It's a great streaming device that offers a wide variety of both paid and free content.One nit is that while Roku claims the Stick+ has long-range wireless capability, I've found the wireless range is similar to the 2016 Streaming Stick with no discernible improvement. The Stick+ in my bedroom has no issues with either the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz bands which is about 30 feet from the router. A Stick+ used in another bedroom about 12 feet farther away from the router has difficulty accessing the 5GHz band and really only works with the 2.4 GHz band.I've read other reviews which state the Stick+ tends to overheat. Even now during the heat of summer and after using the Stick+ for several hours at a time, I haven't that issue in 3 months of use. The only real problem I've had is that the device indicated that there was insufficient power. The Stick+ is powered through the TV's USB port. Simply unplugging the USB connector and plugging it back in solved that problem. It's happened only once and hasn't come up again. Overall, this device is trouble-free.This is my second Roku product and has cemented Roku as my my favorite streaming device. It's tough to go wrong with Roku.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2020","ed18",7
"I was skeptical, but this is great. As good a quality as the larger player","ROKU makes lots of streaming devices. I have the larger ones for my home system where I want multiple input/output options.I needed one for a simple bedroom TV and decided it was time to try the stick.It plugged directly into the HDMI port. It does need a USB power supply. My TV has a USB port, but only has power when the TV is one. So, if you use the TV port, the ROKU will need to power up each time you turn on the TV. That takes about 30 seconds.It's better to use the included USB power supply, which powers the stick at all times and avoids the ROKU power up issue.Reception and streaming is great. I have had no issues. It connects to the WIFI and has every option I need.My only grief is that ROKU seems to keep adding stations to my viewing options that I have to delete. It is almost like the cell phone with all those apps you don't need, don't want, and didn't ask for.The good news is that they are easy to remove....but they seem to keep on adding more and more apps that have to be deleted.Overall, I'm very happy.

"Glad I switched","As a long time fire tv user, it was time to make a switch after my Fire TV box died after 3 years. I tried the Fire Stick 4k, but after it trying to complete updates for 4 hours, I decided to return it. Boy am I glad I did. The set up on the Roku is way simpler. I like that the home screen just shows apps, rather than the Fire TV interface which bombards you with ads. I like that the home screen can be customized and reorganized while the Fire TV had different screens you had to navigate through to find certain channels. I did have to toy around with it, plugging it into different HDMI ports to get the best configuration, but that is more on my TV than the Roku. My only issue with it is that you have to use the power USB cable that it comes with and it is not too long, but I plan on buying an USB extension cord, as I prefer it to be plugged into an outlet.

I've never owned a roku and was at first hesitant because due to being so used to iOS streaming device.Since I didn't want to spend so much money, I decided to go with the streaming stick. It honestly took me about 10 minutes out the box to set up (would have been less but have to test volume, screen, etc). All I had to do was plug in to HDMI cable, attach power cord to stick and then that cord to usb behind tv an viola! (note: if for some reason the stick doesn't fit or is to tight, you can get a free HDMI extender from ROKU).Pros:Easy set-upUser friendly interfaceRemote has Netflix/Disney +/Hulu and Sling buttonsHas a un-biased platform (basically, all apps are available on Roku, including xfinity stream-can't get this on iOS).Has a free (ad-supported) channel called the Roku channel. This is good for cord cutters.Cons:Bulky Remote","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2020","Rickey R.",7
"It works great!","I wanted to connect a smaller flat screen TV in my home, but not have to pay an extra $9/month for cable box service. I tried pulling in local stations with an antenna, but I got no signal. I then bought this ROKU stick. Plugged it into my TV USB port, followed the directions, set my TV controls to USB, followed the ROKU onscreen directions, and VOILA! I am pulling in LOTS of TV stations, plus at least 20 cable channels. The cable channels mostly require individual subscriptions, but that would happen even if I connected the TV to a cable box.Reception is +10, picture is top notch, ease of use if great. Highly recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2022","fsgregs",7
"Love being a cord cutter!!","I got fed up with cable cost after their last increase and looked for an alternative. I'm 62 and not familiar with all the new tech that's out there, but got a recommendation on the Roku from a Millennial. I ordered the Roku streaming stick to try it out before I cancelled our cable. After receiving it, I plugged it into the HDMI port of the TV, easy onscreen connection to my WiFi and haven't been happier. Immediately cancelled the cable and added YouTube tv for the live news feeds. It's as clear as my cable was and after several months haven't experienced any problems. It had gone out several times, but that was due to a WiFi outage. I would suggest ordering it and try it yourself and insure your WiFi, TV and any other technology you have, is comparable.

"I bought four! (And may not be done yet.)","When it comes to streaming media devices, IMHO Roku is the brand to beat. I already had an older Roku, which I've used since 2012. When I decided to move it into my bedroom, I realized I wanted something more than the few ""smart"" apps on my living room TV. After doing some research I chose to get a Roku Streaming Stick+, and fell in love with it immediately.My girlfriend's bedroom TV had absolutely no ""smart"" features, so I got her a Streaming Stick+; but she decided she didn't want to get into the habit of watching TV in bed (except for the morning newscasts) and gave it to her daughter. A few months later, she upgraded her bedroom TV -- larger and better screen, but again no ""smart"" apps -- and then she injured her hip and had to spend a couple of weeks off her feet as much as possible. Ity was nearly Christmas anyway, so I bought her another Streaming Stick+, and this time she loved it! (She's hooked on ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"".)Then I decided to give a Streaming Stick+ to my sister for Christmas. Yep, she loves it too! She prefers classic movies and TV series from her childhood, and the various Roku channels have a wealth of such programming. Dhr has hinted that she wouldn't mind having a second Streaming Stick+, for her bedroom TV; so I may be guying my fifth one soon. Or perhaps my fifth and sixth, since the Streaming Stick+ has a few channels available that my original Roku doesn't seem to have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2019","Walter Luffman",7
"Great to have all our streaming apps in one place","We have been using streaming apps for the past year over cable and have an LG Smart TV. We ordered HBOMax through Hulu and found afterwards that you need to download the HBOMax app to get all the content. Well we also found out the LG Smart TV doesn't support the HBOMax app. We tried the Firestick first and didn't care for the interface much so tried the Roku and it is great. We are able to download all our apps through Roku and access them easily from the menu. The remote is simple to use and is a much cleaner user experience.

"Don't wait to cut the cord!!","I wish I had cut the Xfinity cord earlier! Hooked this up in less than a minute. Downloading my netflix, youtube and amazon prime took about another 5 minutes. Then added sling blue for $30/month which took about 2 minutes. Bought my own modem for $70.00 instead of the $14/month rental I've been paying comcast for 7 yrs. I still have to use them for internet but my bill went from $160.00/month with no premium channels to $80.00. Streaming quality excellent (was having issues before with netflix and amazon). You will have to adjust to the different format but it's not hard. The voice remote is a dream! I ask it to turn on closed captioning whenever I watch my british shows on PBS lol.

"Helped me CUT THE CORD","I LOVE my ROKU. I recently re did my cable/streaming set up. I now only get internet. There are so many other options out there that will cut your cable bill in half and in my case in fourths. I get free NETFLIX with my T-mobile phone plan. I am a member of AMAZON prime so I get streaming with them. I added HULU and I'm golden. I do not miss my cable, HUZZAH!!This little stick has a VERY small footprint. It plugs right into the back of my TV, it has all the features plus a voice recognition ( I have not tried yet) like their small ROKU box.

"Got sick and tired of paying through the nose to be forced to watch endless commercials","Recently we got just sick and tired of paying $140 a month to be forced to watch endless commercials and ten-year-old reruns. I have been an Amazon Prime member and a real fan of the Fire TV Stick I've been using in addition to my cable service for years now, so when we decided to cut the cable bill and upgrade to a newer version of the Firestick we became interested in the ROKU Streaming Stick as well because we have heard a lot of great things about ROKU too. So I got one of each. I don't regret either. And I DONT miss the cable bill either!The ROKU streams beautifully, rarely ever an issue, EVER, with pausing to buffer; Loss of signal NEVER happens, and the picture is crisp and clear--actually as good as if not better than what I experienced with paid-for cable TV. My only real complaint is the sound: I have to crank-up the volume on my TV to get enough volume to understand what is going on.I enjoy the flexibility that ROKU offers in-that I can sign-on to Prime, HULU, or any channel available, including the ROKU Channel (Which I've come to enjoy immensely). I love that I have control to watch what I want, when I want it, without having to spend 40% of the time I've PAID for being force-fed ad after ad after ad, ad-nauseum. On most free Channel Apps I find they only show two to four commercials per break, and there are fewer breaks making the advertising tolerable. I don't mind watching a few ads to compensate for watching TV for free. I just HATE watching endless commercials on a service that I'm paying for!I also like that you can purchase or rent movies right from your TV and that there are so many new releases available.Sure! The move to ROKU has taken some adjustment, but it's soooooo much better than cable TV! And I'm putting that 140 bucks a month I used to spend on cable TV to much better use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2019","G. E. Glaum",8
"Still great after all these years.","ALERT! If you intend to power your stick with the included USB extension power connector (recommended), do yourself a favor and buy a USB EXTENSION cable (I recommend 10ft), NOT POWER cable, along with your Streaming Stick+. I use it on a 55in oled and Roku’s included extension isn’t sufficient. If you read the fine print on Amazon’s list of power cables, they are NOT COMPATIBLE with the Streaming Stick+. That said, this little remote is still so satisfyingly sturdy, dependable and functional it brings a smile. For streaming I much prefer the Stick+ over my TV’s bells & whistles remote. Connecting the Roku was a breeze and it integrates as if it is native to the TV. I don’t use voice commands so I can’t comment on alexa integration but streaming quality and app availability (the reason I bought it) is superb.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2021","Greg B.",8
"Packed with features and well worth it","This is a great little gadget if you don’t have a smart TV and/or are an Xfinity customer with a TV that doesn't have a cable box. I've been able to ditch the useless little free receiver that Comcast supplied after I exceeded the number of cableboxes that were included with my plan. The Comcast receiver only picked up non-HD channels. With Roku and the new Xfinity app, I not only have all of my HD channels, but I've also got Netfix, Amazon Prime, Tubi, etc. On top of that, the little Roku remote allows me to control the TV volume and power, so I don't need to hassle with multiple remotes. Some people have complained that the Roku remote is not friendly since it doesn't have a keypad, but the settings button will open a virtual keypad and allow you to enter a TV channel. It takes an extra step, but that is a minor inconvenience and, for me, not worth the loss of a star when you consider all that you get. Setup was a breeze, picture quality is excellent, and operation is responsive and easy. My only regret is that I didn’t buy this sooner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2020","T Doherty",8
"ROKU is good, but not for me","The Roku device works perfectly except for the voice recognition. I experience difficulty with voice recognition on other devices and this may be more a problem with the quality of my voice in old age. I have no problem using Roku or the remote. I give Roku 5 stars. Navigating the streaming services is another matter. The streaming service channel guide is not friendly, and I've tried many, Sling, Hulu, YouTube TV, etc. Information on what's playing is limited compared to Cable TV box. No ability to switch back and forth between channels, no direct channel access, no numeric access to channels, have to scroll. Tolerable but not ideal. And no fault of Roku. Streaming navigation limit is the fault of the streaming service.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2022","William R.",8

The streaming quality is superb. Navigating the interface isn’t super speedy but it’s not sluggish either.Another plus of this stick is its ability to use hotel and dorm Wifi. I couldn’t manage to get my chrome cast device to work with hotel Wifi because of the sign-on page the hotel uses, but it was pretty easy using this stick and my iPhone/iPad.

Ordered this little unit for a mere $46 and now the TV is just like a brand new smart TV. This Roku boots up fast, apps open fast, and the remote even operates my TV power and volume. The remote has a great feel to it, not cheap. From the time I press the power button on the Roku remote(which powers up the the TV and the Roku) it takes 12 seconds to be on Netflix.

"Great value, fully functional","The interface is fast, switching between apps is quick and easy. The remote could use a jump forward button like the jump back button. It jumps back 15-20 seconds which is handy. There are 4 preprogrammed shortcut buttons to instantly open those 4 apps. It would have been more handy to be able to reprogram them for app shortcuts I actually use. I don't use sling or Hulu so those buttons are useless. I'm also not a fan of volume buttons on the side of the remote that are easy to accidently press just holding the remote. The streaming quality so far has been surprisingly top notch. From HD to 4k, the picture is consistently beautiful. Even the high definition audio is passed through instead of being downconverted to regular Dolby digital, when available. I think physical blu ray and 4k discs still offer better uncompressed audio and video resolution, but this streaming stick+ performs better than I expected.

"Excellent Roku streaming device!","We've been a Roku user since 2006 and our previous Roku 3 was giving us an issue where we would be watching a show on Amazon Prime and the show would disappear and it would then go to the Roku menu and we would see our saved channels disappear one by one. We thought it may be due to the old Roku 3 so we bought this Roku 4K Stick and the same thing started to happen. We thought our Roku account got hacked so we changed our password and still the same problem. So we contacted Roku and they suggested to delete our account and create a new account. That solved our problem! We decided to keep this 4K Stick since we have a 4K tv, was inexpensive and is more portable for travelling. It has been working great ever since. Love the voice command and the cleaner look of the 4K Stick vs the Roku 3 device you need to plug in with power.

"Definitely Would Recommend","I have an older Smart Tv and I was having issues with the apps crashing while I was using them. Or they would lose connection to the WIFI. A friend recommended getting a Roku. I did some researched and I felt that this one was what I needed for my TV and steaming needs.When I went shopping, I saw that Amazon had the best deal and because I have Prime it was here the next day!Installation was pretty simple and straight forward. The only thing that might cause problems for others is the cord from the stick to an outlet. Mine stretched justs fine but someone else might find it too short depending on how far your TV is from an outlet.Once it's up and running you do have to take the time to sign in to all your accounts but after that, it's done.Since I have bought this I have not had any of my streaming apps crash.

"Works Great","We bought this because my DVD player no longer could stream Amazon and we have lots of movies on Prime Instant Video. I compared this to the Firestick. I initially was going with the Firestick. What changed my mind was the fact that Roku was updated for Disney+ and Apple TV. Which I also have subscriptions for. They have the buttons for these right on the remote as well as Amazon and Netflix. I did not see that with the Firestick. The Roku was very easy to install and even came with a smaller cable where you can connect the Roku to using the USB port so that you don’t have to plug it into the wall. Other devices have that sold separately and can run an additional 10$. The remote paired easily with my TV remote. So you can use the Roku remote to turn your TV and manage the volume/mute. The only thing you will need your TV for is to change the Input.

We watch YouTubeTV, Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Hulu with the Roku. After a month or more of confirming that we could live without cable TV, we cancelled it. Now we're only paying the cable company for internet service.YouTubeTV is our replacement for regular cable, and while the cable company overall offered more features (like the ability to get a synopsis for what is currently playing), YouTubeTV's unlimited cloud recording capability at least partially makes up for whatever other shortcomings it has.I like the ability to unplug the Roku stick and take it with me.

"A new cord-cutter is convinced. Wish I did this years ago!","So great, so great, so great. What was I thinking all these years? Here's the deal: A lot of these cord-cutting options don't really pan out, because you have to pay $40/mo for YouTube or the other big ones. What's the point, then? you save some, for sure, but... it's never seemed worth it, to me. But now there's Philo TV, which has ALL the channels I watch - no other service does, under $25/mo. Philo is $16. !!! Awesome! And it has Comedy Channel, History, DIY, FYI, and HGTV. If you have Amazon Prime, you get PBS Masterpiece! Through in another $5/mo and you get all of PBS, as a subscriber - and it's a tax deduction.As for Roku Streaming Stick+... I like it much better than the Fire Stick. It's just more fun, and you can change the ""theme"" for free now. Easy to use, and the remote has Voice Commands!! Awesome! It instantly learns how to control the volume and Power for your TV, too. Now you're down to one remote. My only gripe would be it would be REALLY nice to have a backlight on the remote. But that's a minor thing. Still... it would be nice.Picture quality is excellent. Programs never pause. The interface seems pretty fast. You do have to wait sometimes when going between shows, but look at it this way; it's a lot quicker than sitting through even one short commercial.One other thing that takes getting used to - in a good way - is you don't really need to ""tape"" anything. you just say what program you like to watch, and it ""saves"" all upcoming episodes for you.

However, despite having a HDMI television, the Roku stick has worked fine. I recommend going with the 4K stick anyway, because the decision has already been made by the industry; 4K, whether you feel it’s overhyped/overrated or not will be the next wave.I love the interface of Roku. I couldn’t imagine an easier interface to navigate around and select what apps I want to watch. Another thing that swayed me toward Roku over the other streaming devices was that Roku doesn’t have a dog in the race so to speak. They will add any app that they feel is worthy to their system.

"Roku is a royal PITA!!! Unendurable any more! Avoid it. Get an Amazon Firestick instead","This Roku Streaming Stick + has been a royal PITA since I first got it. First of all was the multiple instances in which I had to log in with a username and password just to get access to the various apps. I could understand being required to do this perhaps once for each app (to register for each service), but not multiple times for the same app. I am in the comfort and security of my own home on a password protected (automatic entry for all my devices ALL DAY EVERY DAY) wifi system. I am not worried about hackers or otherwise unauthorized use of their streaming service. Nor should Roku.Undoubtedly, the Fast Forward and Rewind functions are the most aggravating and infurating things about the service, or lack thereof. Both are either too slow or way too fast. And the 10 second rewind function (why no 10 second FFWD option-ignorant!) no longer works. It will freeze the picture and after a 10 second delay or so, it will pick up right back where you left off, with no rewind. And ostensibly, it should be additive, such that if I press this button 5 times, it will go back 50 seconds. But it doesn't do so. And trying to find your way back to a scene you missed for whatever reason is maddening. It takes the patience of a monk to endure the slowest rewind speed. And there is no rational progression beyond that for the next increments of FFWD or REW speeds. It goes into hyper drive on the second push, what is typically reserved for the 3rd or 4th press of the button. Moreover, I have encountered too many disruptions of service where the picture freezes during buffering. To top it all off, customer service is a nightmarish merry-go-round to get through.Don't waste your money. The Amazon firestick does not put me/you through any of this mess, delivers consistent performance, offers both a 10 second rewind AND forwarding function, does not make you log in multiple times (only had to do so twice; one other for Sling subscription initiation), has only frozen in buffering once or twice for less than 10 seconds each time and has a better interface (which helps you find the shows you'd be interested in quicker). Moreover, Amazon customer service is excellent and readily available for help. I had one instance in which I allowed their technician active X remote control. He quickly, quietly and politely resolved the problem. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER ROKU DEVICE AS LONG AS I LIVE!!!

"Mom loves her Rokus...","My mom is more tech savvy than people half her age (80!) What she can't figure out for herself she knows to come to me for help. Years ago I bought her a Roku 3 so she could easily watch Netflix in her Living Room. She asked about getting one for on for her bedroom TV. I got the Stick+ because there was no ethernet connection in there and I'm not big on depending on Wifi to work consistently. I hooked it up and it wouldn't plug into the back of her TV because of the HDMI jack placement. I checked and Roku will send you a short HDMI extension cable for FREE! Got the cable 3 days later and it all setup great with a very strong Wifi signal. She recently cut the cable and went all internet and uses the Rokus for her Streaming TV service (she likes Philo the best for price and channels she wants). I used the enclosed power supply as her TV's USB port doesn't put out enough juice. So all is good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2019","D. H. Sempeck",10

When it asks for your card information at the time of your account creation, just scroll down to the ""skip this step"" button and you won't be charged for anything. I don't know why people get so worked up about that.Anyway, the remote is good quality and if you set it up it'll be your only remote since it controls the tv power and volume. You might need a second remote to change your HDMI input but I'm not yet 100% sure about that because the Roku is the only thing I personally keep plugged in.I've been through 3 Rokus at this point and this one is by far the best and fastest one. 10/10 would recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2021","William Oropallo",10

Our 1st Roku won't update anymore, so I think our experience will be seamless with them all working the same way on each TV. On New Year's Eve we returned our cable box and are saving over $125 a month. So far we seems to have a better selection of shows WE want to watch with the Roku Channels and our Fire Stick. We haven't had any problems with the remote recognizing the stick, which is in an HDMI port in the back of the TV. The only time we lost our signal was the power plug falling out of the Roku. That was from the repeated moving of the TV to hook up a new antennae. My fault!

Easy installation and it brings in YouTubeTV, which is a big set of channels. Very satisfied.I've had these two streaming sticks (plus) for almost two years -- one in the bedroom and the other in the living room. Oh, and a third in the basement. Almost forgot that one. The router is in a different room down the hall from ALL the rooms. Yes, there are problems, but the problems are mostly the result of glitchy service from Charter/Spectrum. Now, with COVID and everyone at home -- apparently permanently -- they don't have enough servers to manage the number of customers online all the time. Also, change batteries when the remotes get wonky. I have a lot of high quality (Panasonic Eneloop) batteries rechargeables and at least I know I'm not adding more poison to local dumps. You can bury the batteries on Amazon and they really ARE the best by far.

I read reviews before buying & can happily say that I had no issues with the signal from my remote reaching my Roku device from across the room. The only thing is it does stay running even when you turn the tv off, therefore when I go to the living room to watch Netflix it will say that too many devices are using this account, & it's because the bedroom was streaming it when I turned the tv off but the roku stayed on.

"Good when WiFi is weaker, supports 5Ghz, makes your TV a smart TV","I bought this as a gift for a friend who has a weak router. It picks up the WiFi signal (incl 5Ghz band) and streams smoothly. Note that several other Roku products don't support 5Ghz, and if you live near other people, old 2.4Ghz band can get congested and flaky. This one advertises it's more sensitive WiFi antenna and that seems to be a valid claim based on what I can see.Otherwise, it is a Roku, which is a fine, no subscription, and low cost alternative to AppleTV or other similar TV and streaming devices. A little heavy on the ads (unobtrusive mostly, and only when you're picking a service, doesn't affect the streaming content in any way).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2021","TomH",11

The Roku also gets the Amazon Prime TV, and has dedicated pushbuttons for Hulu, Netflix etc. Part of the setup is to get it to recognize the TV so it's single-button on-off, volume control from the Roku control, also nice. It has much better wifi sensitivity than my old Fire TV box, too. The only mildly annoying part of setup is that you have to go to Roku.com/connect to activate it and finish the setup.

"better than Cable","What an incredible little piece of equipment!

If I miss the news time, I can see it again at 9, 10pm, whenever. We don't watch too much on broadcast tv, can't stand the 40 minutes of commercials sometimes and 20 minutes of show. After checking out the Roku experience for 4 weeks, we are going to cancel all TV with Comcast. We do need them for internet, but we can use 55 mbps from them and it will accommodate all streaming.

The software in my Blu-Ray player was very rarely updated and while it worked the newer versions of the the Hulu, Netflix, and Prime apps available via the Roku Streaming Stick+ were very welcome. Software starts up much quicker than with the previous Blu-Ray player apps. Works well enough that I bought the 4k Ultra box for the TV in the living room to replace the Fire Stick. So far very happy with the performance of both this Streaming Stick+ and the 4k Ultra Box. The box is faster than the stick.

Heck I could use in any hotel room.2. it uses 5 GHz wifi band for connecting to my wifi. I wanted that vs lower speed 2.4 GHz band3. has voice control. I use it for search. e.g., ""Pixar movies"". Then it shows me which streaming services have the Pixar movies (e.g., Netflix, Amazon Prime, ...) and I jump directly into that service to watch that movie.The Roku OS and interface updates often, so I'll get latest available.

Used an extension you can get for free from roku that drops it lower behind the tv to increase communication w the remote.

I have a Roku 3, but I wanted to get something that I could use to enjoy UHD on a newer TV. Besides the fact that I can access UHD content, I think the stick actually might work better than my Roku 3 does. I've only had it for a couple weeks, though. If I run into any significant issues with it, I will be sure to update my review.One note, in case it might help some, is that I had originally hoped to plug the stick into my A/V receiver, which would then feed to my TV. However, my A/V receiver could only output a maximum resolution of 1080p. So that kind of defeated the purpose of getting the new stick. I ended up plugging it into my TV directly and then using an optical audio cable to run to my A/V receiver.

"So much better than Amazon Fire!","I have twelve Alexa devices in my home. So it was natural I'd also use the Amazon Fire TV devices. But after a few years they kept glitching with more and more problems. I also didn't like the Amazon interface that mixed free movies with fee-based movies.

Only “complaint” about ROKU in general, as I added other devices like ROKU streaming sticks, I had to modify each home page on each device for each TV I added.

This particular unit is in our upstairs master bedroom, and our router is on the first floor, but there is zero lag in streaming and the picture and sound are sharp and clear. I was so happy with it that I picked up the Roku Express for our living room.I have not yet experimented with voice control, but I can see an obvious value to it.

One concern was over some reviews saying they were being charged but I will quote the set up guide ""Roku does not charge for activation support - beware of scams."" I was not charged at all. I was also wondering if my TV could power this stick or if it required a wall outlet. The box provides both a cable for your TV to power the stick if you have a USB port and a wall outlet in case you don't or if your TV does not have sufficient power.

"One of the Best Streaming Devices Out There","I’ve had several streaming devices and I always come back to Roku. I wanted a new 4K device and saw this one at Amazon. So I picked it up. Just like all other Rokus I’ve had it Waes super simple to setup and like to Hulu, PS Vue and other content providers. The UI is quick and I like it better than other streamers (sorry Amazon Fire TV). The only drawback I see is you have to use the provided mini-USB power cable as it has a built in antenna for WiFi. You can not use any old mini-USB you have around the house, and if this one breaks I have to go back to Roku to get another.

I had to buy a separate HDMI ""gender bender"" adapter to hook mine up to an existing HDMI (double male) cable, just so it could fit my TV. Once set up though, it works well and produces an excellent 1080p picture from a variety of streaming sources.

"KISS YOUR WIFI GOODBYE","I bought this Roku several months ago. For a while it worked. But as of about 4 weeks ago the remote started having a hard time connecting with the Roku itself. It would periodically freeze up and input would not be detected. The Roku remote control uses IR to control the TV, which worked absolutely fine, but it uses WiFi to control the primary device. Furthermore, the WiFi for the remote control isn't for your home network, the Roku creates its own. It's called WiFi Direct and it's awful.Not only is WiFi Direct a security vulnerability into your entire network, but it also stomps all over your main WiFi router's frequencies and causes issues for any other WiFi devices you are using, INCLUDING your Roku! We started experiencing freezes and timeouts on all devices, including the remote and Roku streaming, starting about 3 weeks ago. I had been meaning to upgrade to a Unifi AP anyway, and so partly because I assumed it was our own WiFi's fault I installed a very nice Unifi AP, which is fast and lag-free. Or was. The Roku also started behaving itself once the new WiFi was put in, but only for about 16 hours. The next day my laptop was once again struggling to connect. There were frequent disconnects. So I unplugged the Roku entirely and put it to the side. My WiFi has been fast and lag-free since.The problem is fairly straight-forward. The Unifi AP is good at channel selection and plays well with other devices. The Roku sucks at this and takes whatever channels it wants, and will change frequencies for no apparent reason. I didn't pull out an RF spectrum analyzer, but I have enough experience with WiFi to recognize this for what it is.The WiFi Direct is a terrible feature. The newer Roku models support turning it off, but my model, which must be a lower generation, does not allow it. This is bad engineering, introducing problems where none need exist. I will be using a PC running Ubuntu from now on and will never buy another dedicated streaming device. They are inflexible and insecure and when we use them we are at the mercy of the manufacturer and whatever vulnerabilities they have not addressed. It was a mistake to buy this piece of junk.UPDATE: We set up a new TV and since my earlier problems with this device I have upgraded to a good custom firewall. As soon as I plugged the Roku back in it started disrupting Wifi on other devices. The Roku firmware is fully updated. I give up on this device. I have ordered a Google Chromecast, which does not have a terrible Wifi-based remote.I broke the casing off the Roku and then broke the PCB in half with my bare hands and smashed it with a sledge. This was the most satisfying part of my entire Roku experience. Never buying a Roku again.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2021","empbac",16

Still it occasionally had some buffering on the wireless as my TV is a fair distance from my router. After I did several hours of research I decided the best value would be the RoKu Stick Plus. Wow!

It also gives you the opportunity to get other, more mainstream apps, that didn't come installed on your DVD, BluRay, DVR, or other devices.

It works with WiFi and your TV's HDMI (in) port! In my case (living out of town) you want a good Internet Provider (NOT HugesNet!!!!) with plenty of speed and bandwidth - for general internet needs anyway. I guess my only complaint at all is that the stick doesn't ""turn off"". If someone has watched the Stick (HDMI) input and turned the TV off, and I turn on the TV to watch Antenna TV the Roku stick is still on, and I have to change inputs back to Antenna, that is my ONLY complaint - not a big deal.

"Easy Setup - Works Well for Streaming Video Channels","I've purchased two of these Roku Sticks and am please with how easy they are to install. It took minutes to setup Roku on my Samsung and LG smart TVs. These sticks are nice because they stay out of sight up behind the TV. My older Roku system consisted of a small box that was attached with a cable to my TV. Two criticisms: the remote sold with this new Stick model lacks the headphone jack of the older remote. I liked the option of simply plugging my headphones into the remote. Also, the new remotes also have several buttons for quickly accessing channels like Netflix, Hulu, etc. I am not a fan of these buttons for proprietary/subscription channels. In short the older remote was better - simple and easy to use with headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2018","Brian Petula",19
"Roku or Amazon Stick ???? So here the answer.","At first i bought ROKU Stick+ to make my tv smart. Roku is really nice product.. But it doesn't have support to web browser, what means that you can't enter directly to the websites. What is good if you live in a country where you have free movie streaming websites. Even browser screen mirroring apps are worst on Roku. So i made some research and found out that Fire TV Stick have several web browsing apps.

I just love the voice thing that lets you say the name of a tv show or movie or even the name of an app and it finds it.

"Reliability and service nightmare","Roku streaming devices are wonderful in many ways. However, I’ve purchased two of these Streaming Stick-Plus’s, and I feel compelled to tell you about their less wonderful aspects: Both of the units I purchased failed pretty catastrophically. I needed their customer service to help me. And their customer service ranges from nightmarish to effectively non-existent.My first Stick+ failed after just nine days when the remote control just spontaneously completely died. I managed to get their so-called customer service to send me a replacement remote, but only after 7 completely solid, non-stop, super-ultra-nasty hours on text chat with them, including a lot of threats from me to send the whole thing back to Amazon for a refund (which is what I definitely actually should have done).My second Stick+ has overheating problems whenever the house warms up - despite good ventilation, added HDMI extender cable, etc., etc. I might possibly maybe be able to get it replaced under their supposed 1-year warranty, but, absolute best case, it would take many more hours of my time, and return shipping costs, and weeks without TV service, with no reason to expect any good outcome, just more very unpleasant, badly wasted time and money.Bottom line: You can be pretty sure you will have reliability problems and need service help with this product. But you should regard Roku’s warranty and support as non-existent, effectively just a scam, because it is. If you buy one of these units, be sure to try to flush out any problems within the first 30 days; and if you find any problems, just return it to Amazon, don’t waste your time with or expect any help from Roku.How badly can you treat your customers and still expect them to give you any credit?","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2020","CC",21

One reason I did get a Ruku over other streaming devices is you're not limited to content because a certain device isn't brand owned or is a competitor service. Another benefit of this model is portability so if I ever go somewhere I can have most of my content and services. The main reason I described I needed a streaming device I my Bluray player does not support Disney+ nor a few other services I use like the Xfinity app. My brand new 4K 50"" Vizio TV in my bedroom also doesn't support Disney+ or other services as well but does have different Casting options ( Chromecast, Apple Airplay) but not everyone knows how to do that.Con: nothing to do with the physical product but you need Credit card information before to even setup an account to use the device.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2020","BriH",21

Picture quality was fine and it is easy to use. You have to consider other factors however such as the Wifi speed and ability to plug it into mounted screens. The free Wifi was fortunately good except during prime time in the evening when people at the resort were more likely to be using the Wifi for computers or other purposes. The TV was cable connected so that wasn't a factor but in a hotel where the TV also depends on WiFi you may have to purchase a faster plan. One of the TV's was mounted and it was difficult to plug the Roku stick into the side plug. Also, Hulu was not available outside of the US so take into consideration whether the service you want to stream will do so internationally. Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO and the like were all fine.

I was so frustrated with the Samsung smart TV UI that I dreaded getting ready to watch a show.

Their phone number is the worst too as I can’t get to speak to customer service representative either!Update: I finally talked to a representative and they are sending a HDMI cable extension as a potential solution.Update 2: The short HDMI cable extension solution worked! 5 starts for Roku's customer service!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2020","Bill",23
"A snap to set up, and works great","This is remarkably easy to set up and to use. Streaming quality is excellent. Remote hooked up to my TV in just a few seconds. I have not tried the Voice Control, as I have an aversion to our future Robot Overlords. This is as easy to use as a Firestick (which I also have) but as the Roku also allows you to access Amazon Prime through it, I find myself using the Firestick less and less.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2021","The Tin Man",23
"Great for travel.","Bought this for vacations after I lost our older version (sorry hunny!).(SKIP down if you already own a Roku). All Roku devices have essentially the same setup, menu, and features. It’s very easy to get started, find apps, and navigate. It has minimal advertisements and less “in your face” suggestions as compared to an Apple TV. We are an Apple family and have switched to AppleTV twice...then promptly went back to Roku. Unfortunately Roku’s search is still a mess and more-or-less useless.The only issue we have with Our Roku’s (we use 3 different versions of them scattered through the house) is sound quality. If you stream through a high end home theater system, be aware that Roku and PLEX do not support much more than basic 5.1 channel surround. This is a problem for audiophiles but no biggie for others.(ABOUT this Roku vs others)- we bought it for traveling. It plugs into hotel TVs easily. Make sure to call the hotel’s tech support and they will register the Roku’s MAC address (found on the back of the Roku stick) so it will connect to WiFi.Finally the remote can control your TV. This has been a common complaint for some time now and I’m so happy it’s finally an included feature. This makes it easy for the kids to navigate the hotel TV and we don’t have to use the nasty public remote.The only con, and it should be expected, is speed. The Roku sticks are ALWAYS slower than the Roku boxes in our experience. If you’re going from Roku Ultra or even a Roku 3 to this you will notice everything takes about twice as long to load. Menus are still responsive and navigation is fine but actual loading times is noticeably slower.Still the best “cord cutting” device out there vs FireTV/AppleTV/etc. This is also a worthy upgrade over the older streaming stick with the improved video quality and universal remote.Update: We took it to Disney and did not have to register the MAC address. We just plugged it in, selected the WDW guest WiFi, and away we went. Bonus that WDW uses Samsung tv in their rooms and we have one at home so I didn’t even have to program the remote.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2018","Itsme",23

"Roku Streaming Stick+ great product!","The Roku stick + boots up fast and no issues with connection to wifi network. The only negative thing is the device gets warm to hot to touch sometimes. We only use the device about 1 hr per day as a secondary tv so the heat issue is not that important. We fixed some heat issue by hooking up an hdmi extender cable from the tv to roku stick + which seems to remove some of the Heat issues. Recommend getting 3ft hdmi extender cable with purchase of the roku stick + .","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2019","Max",23
"Roku was an easy setup, good quality video","I did my homework before buying this Roku Streaming Stick+. So, if you've done yours, then you already know why I bought it: it has higher speed & longer range WiFi than most other models, has up to 4K resolution, has an easy setup, and offers more streaming possibilities than Amazon's Firestick products. What the Firesticks can do that this cannot is play games, but that was not very important to me. I also do not like that the Firestick menus are more complicated AND they tend to throw their own Amazon products more prominently rather than other streaming options. All in all, the Roku line is simpler to use right out of the box and this model has excellent features as above.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2019","athurman",24

"If you're on the fence, go ahead and hop over. It's absolutely worth it!","We cut our cable a few years ago and invested in a Vizio smart tv. We watch all our shows on Netflix and Hulu. However, the tv network ""The CW"" was taken off of Hulu so we then had to download the cw app on our phone and plug it directly to the tv in order to watch our shows on that network (The vizio smart tv doesn't have an app store. You just get what you get...). This got really old! We have friends who have Rokus so I decided to do some more research. They happened to be on sale at the time and I also had an amazon gift card so we decided to make the purchase. We are sooooo glad we did. No more plugging our phones into the tv and there is also a great selection of all kinds of other tv shows and movies. This is absolutely worth the purchase. The reason why I got this specific model over one of the cheaper ones is because of some of the specs. Faster wifi connection, voice control, better remote, etc. These admittedly are kinda nit-picky and unnecessary but I like my tech so I went for it. I would encourage you to compare the specs of the different models and if those upgrades don't matter to you then go ahead and get one of the cheaper ones. Make the purchase, you'll be happy you did!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2019","Charles Halford",24
"Works Fantastic","This is a rare find that does exactly what it says. I have a TV in my bedroom at the far end of the house from wifi router. Streaming, especially YouTube, was always hit or miss.

"Quick and easy to install. Streams fast","This is one of the fastest installs I have done. It took me more time to get the Roku stick inserted in the HDMI slot behind the TV due to the wall mount space restriction. Do note, this requires a power source, so do ensure a power strip or outlet is nearby as the cord is a few feet long not very long (understandably); the other option to charge it via a USB slot on the TV; which worked well in my case.Once installed, the interface finds your Internet connection and connects to it (pwd. required of course).Will be buying another for other rooms.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2019","Faisal Y.

"Upgrade from my Chromecast","I have been using Chromecast the past year +. I eventually bought 4 when I dropped DirectTV (very worth it!). I was unhappy with the continual buffering during sporting events and the fact that it wasn't easy for my wife to figure out. I bought the Roku and am extremely happy! It is very easy to initially set up and you need to spend some time linking the channels that you want to add to it, but once that is done is works extremely well. The picture quality is excellent (I have a 4K tv) and it is extremely easy to use. I will be incorporating these onto my other tv's.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2018","RoxyS",24

Other models were cheaper but I decided to go with this one because of the all in one remote (I was tired of having a roku remote and a tv remote to turn on the TV and adjust the volume). It all works great. The stick is plugged in behind the TV but we have no trouble changing the channels and adjusting volume which is such an improvement over our older version that you had to make sure you had a clear line of site and point it exactly right.I have only owned this for a month or 2 but I am very happy with my purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2019","Patricia",24

"Roku is okay - not everything I'd hoped, but ""it'll do . . .""","Had to update my review - every day - multiple times a day - my Roku disconnects from the wifi.When I IMMEDIATELY go through the prompts - it tells my wifi strength is either Good or Excellent and lets me reconnect. Anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour later - it happens again. BEYOND frustrating.I should also note - when it happens - I'm pretty much sitting in front of TV with my laptop - connected to wifi - and my laptop connection is fine / untroubled. This fact - coupled with the fact that it immediately allows me to reconnect leads me to believe that this is a Roku issue - not an issue with my ISP or wifi signal / strength.I even followed some steps on a YouTube tutorial (basically rebooting / refreshing via Settings) and that hasn't helped.Complete waste of my money. I'm so angry with Roku right now.Like a lot of folks, I have Comcast, and I, therefore, have an insane monthly cable / internet bill. So, of course, I'm always looking for ways to cut the cord OR save some money while I'm still cable bound.I'd read an article about how some enterprising folks were using Roku and the Comcast app - which is free, right now - but it's in beta stage - to save on cable rental fees. I have 5 cable boxes (in addition to the DVR) - so I decided to give Roku a try - primarily to check out how it works as an option to get rid of my cable boxes.The set-up did NOT go off without a hitch. When I entered my network password, initially, it accepted it, and a message appeared on the screen letting me know that the system needed to re-start to complete the installation. I was thinking, 'Wow! That was insanely quick!'But then . . . when it re-started, it kept telling me that my password was incorrect. This went on for about 2.5 hours. No exaggeration. I knew my password was correct. So I just continued working (I was parked on the couch with my laptop before starting the process) and re-tried the password every 15 minutes or so, and magically, all of a sudden it accepted the password and I finished the set-up.Ultimately, I think the product is 'Okay' - but I would never put on the two TV's we use for heaviest viewing. That's because I'm not crazy about the actual interface. The TV I tried out with today is only a 42 inch - so the massive tiles (for channels) make it difficult to quickly scroll through and get to the channels you want. I tried using the voice function to quickly navigate to the channel I wanted, but that, too, proved cumbersome. For instance, (fictitious channel example - lol) let's say I searched for the 'SAL' channel. It might return results of 'SAL Channel, 'Salads television show' and 'Sal and Andy Solve True Crimes show.' So I scroll down to the 'SAL Channel', and click Ok, then it takes me another screen, where I have an option to Add the SAL Channel. Even though I've already added it. SO you click Add, then it opens.So after trying it out for a few days, I'll definitely keep it. For my office, I got some inexpensive speakers for my computer and that TV is already hooked up as a second monitor so it was just a simple matter of logging into computer and viewing my line-up.So back to what I was saying - why I would never put the Roku on a TV I use heavily - because:1) no voice remote option - no way to manually enter a channel number - so you're scrolling to get to channels which can be kinda cumbersome*2) no way to schedule a recording - you can view recordings now (I guess they won that lawsuit sling TV had against them) - but not schedule them.3) You cannot pause or rewind Live TV and I do that (A LOT)So I plan to order a two more for the other TV's, and I'll wind up purchasing another Samsung TV for the fifth television - because unlike most Smart TV's - Samsung actually has a full-on browser - so you can surf / go to any website and just login / view. It's pretty great - but that's another review . . .","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2018","Denise B",25

It was easy to set up, and very easy to operate. The only issue we have is that occasionally it will freeze up on the welcome screen but we just have to unplug the power from the Roku stick for about 10 seconds and then plug it back in to reboot it and then it's fine. We used to have to do this with our cable box as well so it could just be our internet service.

Better and more configurable GUI. Streams nugs.net where the FireTV cannot. MUCH easier to configure.

I was replacing cable with my TiVo box with this and although I find the UI not quite as good as TiVo, it’s pretty great. I have all my apps set up and watch live tv when I want through YouTube tv. The remote works well but a little flimsy but I do like that Netflix (and others) have their own button. I haven’t yet used my phone for remote but it’s great that is an option, especially since the buttons on the remote don’t light up.If you are even thinking about it, just do it.

I have Cat 6 Ethernet cables to all of my TV locations, so I initially purchased two Roku Ultras, which support Ethernet connections. They work great and I'm very pleased with their quality and performance. I decided to try the Streaming Stick+ to test a wireless connection to the TV in my office. I am also very pleased with the performance of the Roku Streaming Stick+.

Its really easy to use both the controller and interface, its easy to add channels, especially if you have a Roku account, it automatically downloaded all the apps I had on my Roku TV. The voice is like any voice-activated device, it gets it most of the time. It loads pretty quickly, and it sinks to the TV, so I only use one remote.

I had bought the top of the line brand née Apple TV and absolutely hated it. The remote was way too sensitive and would jump from one station to another just by setting it down and I sold it within two weeks. This remote is sturdy and responsive but not so sensitive that you have to handle it with kid gloves. The volume control is easy to use. If I had any complaint at all it would be that the mute button is on the side where you sometimes hit it by mistake. But honestly, that is a minor flaw.

The external antenna on a dongle makes a difference. Set up was easier than the previous model. The payoff is faster loading. We have had cable TV and a sound bar. The on/off and sound volume control features don't work with our set up, and we didn't expect them to. What does work is the ability to link to the highest of the dual band settings of our router.

"Didn’t even realize I was living in slow motion.","This thing is great. I was using my PS4 as a primary streaming device and my Netflix experience varied from “I think that’s a person but it’s hard to tell” to absolute microwaved garbage. I plugged this in and it was a night and day difference. Before Roku, I couldn’t even load a lot of shows or it took a long time to even see them in the Netflix dashboard. Now they load almost instantaneously and without any buffering mid-episode or drop in quality. I went from kind of being able to stream 1080p to easily streaming 4K UHD HDR content with no issue. I’ve been traveling for the last week or so and the Roku stick is amazing for hotels. Once connected to the hotel WiFi it’s as solid as at home and brings your ability to relax after a long day of “vacationing” to a whole other level being able to watch shows you’re actually interested in, instead of grainy hotel cable. I found that the Roku is a more powerful device than the TVs in the hotel rooms in which I stayed, meaning it can push higher quality content than crappy hotel TVs can even accept, creating a bottleneck at the tv. If you are getting tired of a slow connection or weak connectivity, get this thing and watch shows as they were meant to be watched.

The price, the performance, and the cool factor make this a no brainer. Just buy it. Even if you already have a Roku, this one is better.OK, one complaint.

"Awesome, powerful device that really does have 4x the WiFi range!","Having always plugged in my MacBook Pro to whatever TV I own at the time, this wasn't a must-have product for me. It was more of a convenience, a way to watch Netflix without needing to move and connect my laptop, and anything else would be a bonus. I owned a Smart TV while living in Germany and had too many problems to justify spending the extra money on one again when I could just use my laptop. (I travel a lot and usually only live somewhere for a year or two, so the less I can spend on a TV, the better.)I must say, this little streaming stick went above and beyond my expectations. I have never written a review for a product on Amazon before, that's how much I love this thing. Being in SE Asia now, I don't have access to a lot of content, but with Netflix, Plex, and YouTube, it's already more than enough. (Having Spotify would make it perfect, but that's not Roku's fault.) And with silent listening from my phone, I can watch at any time without needing to worry about waking up anyone else in the house. (Perfect for roommates or significant others trying to sleep way earlier than you want to.)The icing on the cake, though, and what drove me to leave this review, is the advanced wireless receiver. My bedroom is down a long hallway in the house, and my laptop and iPhone have a hard time picking it up during the best of times. Not so with the Roku. I was getting HD quality content on the TV. I might even be getting better quality content in the main room where the router is because of this. Maybe I'm still so overly impressed and it's affecting my judgement, but I could swear that it never looked as good when I was using my laptop.Needless to say, I'm going to be using this for a long time to come. Maybe next time I'll spring for a 4K TV, but even without one, this thing is seriously amazing.

The remote control is a big differentiator, it not only pairs wirelessly (Not vie IR, Infrared) that allows control of the Roku without line of sight, but i also has an IR transmitter to allow control of the TV to turn on/off and volume control. So now I only need one remote control. It is fast to respond and was very easy to set up with many fine tuning features and options.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2018","Daz",33
"Best purchase ever","If you are debating on getting this do it. We have a Roku tv in the bedroom and wanted a smart tv for the living room but didn’t want to spend the money. We have been using a chrome cast which doesn’t work half the time and was very frustrating. Finally we decided to get the Roku stick and omg it works so good and the quality is 10x times better!! We didn’t realize the quality sucked so bad on the chromecast until we got this. Also we can watch cable through the spectrum app so we literally only need this one remote now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2020","Shelbi King",33
"Beware of account fees","In 2015 I ordered a Roku streaming stick. It worked fine for a while, but after a year, it quit working. In the meantime, I had purchased a newer tv and was able to access Amazon Prime and Netflix directly through the TV, so I never pursued repairing or replacing the Roku. I was never charged anything for my Roku other than the initial purchase price.I recently acquired Disney +, which I can access directly on my living room tv, but wanted to access it on my granddaughters older tv. I ordered a newer Roku streaming stick to install on her tv. In the process of installing it, I was told to call Customer Service to get technical assistance for my installation. When I called Customer Service they told me that the original Roku was still linked to my account and could not be unlinked. Because this was the second Roku on my account, I would be charged $129.00 for a 5 year basic account. I don't know what a basic account includes, but he said I would not be able to access Disney+ with the basic account. I didn't ask what the other options were, because the $129 was already more than I was willing to pay for an account that I had never been charged for in the past 5 years. I could probably buy her a newer tv and access the Disney+ and it wouldn't cost much more than the Roku.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2020","Barbara A.

"Best roku ever, tv power and volume buttons finally","This is the best Roku I've ever owned, and the first one I am pretty much completely happy with. The new power/volume buttons on the remote control are a game changer, it means you can put your old remotes away and do it all with Roku now. This unit is also much faster and more responsive than the previous generations. They had to really improve processor speed and memory to make sure it could handle 4k video. It also seems to have a much more reliable wifi connection, the one furthest away from my router has no problems streaming high definition content, unlike my old rokus. I also love that you can plug the USB into the back of the TV and so don't need to use an outlet or have anything visibly connected to the TV.

It correctly paired the power and volume controls with my old 32"" Samsung TV.The HDMI1 port on my TV sticks straight out the back of the TV. If I hadn't ordered the free HDMI EXTENDER from Roku, the TV wouldn't have fit close to the wall. I advise everyone to order the extender. This stick is so long, it likely would not fit the main HDMI port on many TVs without the extender. It should be included in the box. Took about a week to receive after I ordered it from Roku.I used the included power adapter rather than take a chance with my TV's USB port. Many TVs were designed not to deliver enough power from the USB port.The power and volume controls on the remote work great on my TV.The WiFi reception is very good.So far, I am very pleased with the Roku Streaming Stick +!UPDATE: I have bought a 2nd Stick+ and use it on a 39” Element TV powered by the TV’s USB port. When TV is first turned on, the TV frequently doesn’t have sound. To get sound, the TV must be repeatedly turned off and on until sound returns.

"Cable cutters take notice can you say Roku ?","Cutting the cable <U+2049><U+FE0F>Roku is a great alternative to cable TV. I’ve installed 5 to replace the recurring monthly fees associated with the cable company box. Saving $100 dollars a month. I’ve also noted my Electric bill declined by $15 a month getting rid of those hot cableboxes so that’s another $180 in savings I didn’t account for.

We love being able to choose the channels we want to watch. Amazon Video, Netflix... you name it they are all available at your fingertips via the Roku. Something for everyone in the home to watch or listen to. Once we got the Roku's we ditched apple tv and all the others we used. No need for them. Roku ecosystem was better for us.

"Even if you have a smart TV, you should buy this!","I have a 2 year old 55"" Samsung Smart TV. My reaction to the Roku after using it for 24 hrs was ""WHY DIDN'T I GET THIS SOONER?!"" Samsung has one of the better smart TV softwares in the Tizen UI, but it does not hold a candle to the Roku. I recommend the Roku to everyone, even if you have a smart TV. Smart TV UI's can be laggy, hard to navigate, lack proper updates and app availability; whereas the Roku really shines. It is ZIPPY with a capital Z, no lagging. It has the most app availability of all platforms, and updates are constant and regular. The home screen is simple and easy to use. I wish I had bought the Roku when I purchased my smart TV, but I assumed I didn't need it, because after all- I was buying a smart TV. What I didn't know was that the Roku is much smarter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2019","Amazon Customer",47

"Voice controls = meh & Parental Controls = c'mon man!","I'm going to go straight into pros and cons:PROS- Super Easy to install.- Voice recognition is very accurate.- Great design and I like the home screen.- Price is fair given alternatives.- Remote programmed on its own to my TV controls.CONS- The voice controls are just MEH! They don't really work within individual applications. For instance, you can't search for a certain show on Netflix while you are in Netflix. It will just search all applications for that show and then make you exit to the home screen in order to select it. It also doesn't automatically recognize whether you own the movie (say on VUDU) or not even when the account is linked.- Parental Controls are not available on the TV home screen or in settings. In fact they are VERY limited and the ONLY way to block purchases is to set up a pin on your Roku website account. I mean c'mon man, its hard enough as it is to keep my 3 year old from ordering accidentally, don't make it harder! *This is the prime reason for the 3-star rating (no pun intended).SUMMARYI am not impressed. I want to like it, but find myself just a little annoyed. Now that I have it all set up, I will most likely keep it, but who knows. I certainly like my friend's Firestick better.

"Streaming quality is top notch. Don't upgrade your internet speed or buy a new router until you try this first!","I purchased this streaming stick because I was having trouble streaming content to my Sony Blu Ray player (Netflix and Amazon Prime). It was so painful to try to watch streaming content and I was searching the internet to find some sort of solution. I wondered if my internet provider was not giving me enough data speed and I also wondered if my wireless router was getting too old, etc. Enter the Roku Streaming Stick+! Now, I can stream anything and no problem. I was absolutely shocked on how good my streaming is now. I went with the plus model due to the fact that it claimed to have a better wireless reception than the regular streaming stick. I don't know if I really needed the plus or if Roku is just that good, but I can report streaming content is not a problem anymore. Now the Sony only play DVDs and BluRay discs. Definitely recommend this. The only thing negative to report is you cannot surf the internet with this or at least I haven't found a way to do that. I have Firefox on my Android phone and on Roku and I can't seem to get that to work at all either. I'm not worried about that because I usually don't surf the internet on my TV but it would have been nice to be able to stream shows from the websites of major networks like CBS (can't stream the free content you can stream on your laptop).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2018","JT",51

"Long-range Remote Design Sucks (batteries)","The concept is fine. The execution is horrid. It is all about the remote, not the stick. I found out, like others, that this remote design eats batteries about every 2 weeks depending on how much you use it. I finally put an ammeter on it and I found that the remote draws 30-150mA for about 45seconds after touching any button. If the remote is used on any reasonable frequency, that is far too much to be supplied by 2-AAA batteries.On the chance it was a defective remote, I got a replacement. Sorry, it is the design of the remote that is the problem. I will be returning the replacement also and getting a Roku with only an IR remote. It is really sad that Roku would hoist this ""long-range RF design"" without a warning.

"Pros & Cons of ROKU vs Firestick","I did not rate the Voice or Alexa integration because I do not use either.After using exclusively firesticks for two years, I decided to add a ROKU because I’d discovered that ROKU supports multiple apps that carry free movie serials, while on firestick those same public domain serials are behind pay walls. I have multiple HDMI slots, so why not use both?The reason ROKU gets 4 stars instead of 5, is because their registration is a royal pain. I can understand why some people appear to give up and return the device. I also would not have given it even 4 stars during my couple weeks, because you separately have to order (for free from ROKU) an HDMI extender which is not included in this box. Then once you do get everything working it takes active exploring to learn one’s way around and make ROKU worth your effort.The major problem with ROKU is their registration process. You can’t use the device until you register it. It only recognizes certain email carriers, and if you’re not using one of them, tough. I wanted to register my device with the same email address I use with my firestick, but no. Luckily I had a gmail account, and ROKU accepted that.The other immediately off-putting aspect of a ROKU versus Firestick that took me a week to overcome is its upfront interface. Firestick’s interface is like being inside an app/streaming service already – it is far better organized and you can save shows/movies from multiple streaming services to a single watchlist. I scarcely ever go into Amazon’s fire tv app itself as the interface above it is so good. ROKU on the other hand essentially has no watchlist sitting above the individual streaming service apps. You have to count on those services having watch lists themselves, and some do not. On ROKU, to find interesting apps having content you want, you must be willing to work and explore.But if you’re willing to explore, that’s when ROKU’s advantages shine. ROKU has literally thousands of available apps/streaming channels, many more than the firestick (most prominent amongst those unique to ROKU being Peacock and Vice TV). Apps on the firestick appear to be more professional/commercial, while on ROKU everything exists down to what I’d label “amateur hour” apps, which while not laid out professionally, are still offering public domain material for free with zero ads. Older content that on a firestick you’d have to pay MUBI or “Best TV Ever” to watch, can be found for free on ROKU.Many streaming apps that exist for both devices, do not work the precise same way in both (though a few do). Some work better on ROKU vs Firestick, and vice-versa. VEVO is my favorite free music app on Firestick; it’s version on ROKU I find unwatchable. IMDb & Pluto TV I cannot stand going into on Firestick (instead I use the firestick’s interface above them), but on ROKU getting into their On Demand works great. Navigation within DistroTV is far smoother in ROKU than Firestick. TUBI works identically in both. Ironically, the side-loaded Peacock app on Firestick has a slight improvement over the legit Peacock app on ROKU (on Firestick, Peacock’s “View All” is on the immediate left, while on ROKU you need to scroll to the far right to find it).Lastly, the picture and sound quality on ROKU is observably superior to firestick (to be forthright, my firestick is 2 years old, my ROKU is new, so there’s that). One negative on ROKU vs Firestick, when I’m travelling then return home, the Firestick remembers my prior WiFi setups, while ROKU seems only able to retain the setting for a single location, requiring me to re-enter my home set up once I’m back.I now switch between the two now depending on what I want to watch. An advantage of having both is that if the two are making different offers for the same streaming service I’m interested in, I can pick the better of the two.Doug Wheeler","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2021","Doug M Wheeler",54

"Nothing but Trouble","Recently we decided to cut the cord and as long-time Roku users we discovered that our old Roku would not be capable of doing the live streaming we would need to access services like Hulu Live or DirecTV Now. After doing some research and based on Amazon customer and outside reviews we decided to upgrade to the Roku Streaming Stick+. After a rocky installation process that took a couple of days we finally got it to work. It was faster than our old Roku and the picture quality was superior. Unfortunately, this did not last long. Like many other reviewers, after about two months (a month past the return window date), we began to have issues. At first we began to experience constant buffering every time we tried to watch a program. And eventually we could not get the programming to start at all and got messages about our connection to the internet and about ""weak signal strength.""And of course whatever the trouble was it always came back to assigning the blame to OUR router, OUR SmartTV, and/or OUR internet provider. We tried everything we could think of including restarting everything, reinstalling everything, and checking the status of our router and our signal (according to the Roku itself, our wifi and internet signals were good to excellent). We went through this over and over again to no avail. One of Roku's recommendations was to mitigate the interference between our router and the Roku stick by having them in close proximity to each other with no walls in between. While our router and Roku were not in the same room, they were in sight of each other. And if that were the problem, why did this arrangement work fine with our old Roku and with this one for the first two months? On the other hand, one of the selling points of the Stick+ was that it would work with a less-than-ideal signal.Finally, after several days of trying and failing to get access to any programming using the stick, we put the unit back in the box and reinstalled our old Roku (which worked just fine).Some avenues of exploration that Roku might consider concern the Stick itself. Our old Roku box is relatively cool to the touch. On the other hand, when the Stick's power cord is plugged into the wall the unit gets extremely hot (even when it is not plugged into the TV). Also, on our Samsung SmartTV the HDMI socket is relatively high on the back of the set and even though the Stick ""clicked"" into place the downward stress with the added weight of the USB power cable pulling on it might have had the effect of weakening the connection. The old expression ""it hangs like a dog's ear"" comes to mind. At one point I even used tape to affix the cables to the back of the TV in an effort to relieve the stress, but like everything else we tried it only worked briefly. As a last resort we requested the free HDMI extender cable that Roku offers in case the Stick+ does not fit your HDMI socket and it did strengthen the connection, but it did not solve the overall problem. We still kept getting messages about signal strength and we still could not successfully access programming. It's as though we had come full circle from the early days of TV when someone in the family had to hold the rabbit ears to get a clear signal. Nowadays you need a volunteer from the audience to hold the Stick in place while wearing an oven mitt.Maybe there just some inherent problems with the Stick+. Six hundred negative reviews (as of this review) should not be ignored.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2019","Bosco",54

"Great streaming even on slow connection","Here are my experiences with the 2017 Streaming Stick+ Roku.First let me specify my setup. I have a slow 2.4 (typically) Mbps Internet connection. Previously I was using a Panasonic BMP110 Blu-Ray player for what little streaming I did. That was mainly used for trying out the Vudu free movies. It was marginal; with my slow connection, sometimes it would work pretty well, and sometimes it would complain and give up intermittently.I have a Yamaha VX-477 Receiver.And it all feeds into a 2011 Panasonic Plasma TV.Setup:It probably isn’t very important, but the remote uses AAA batteries, not AA. I slapped in a couple of Eneloops and it’s happy.I see people complaining about having to give credit card information to activate their Roku. This is not necessary. Go to the page made for this option: my dot roku dot com/signup/nocc, and you can create a Roku account without entering any credit card or PayPal information. I know, because I did it.If you’re wondering about using the Roku with an A/V receiver, that works. I plugged the stick into one of the HDMI inputs on my Yamaha, and it works just fine. 4K wouldn’t cut it, because my receiver doesn’t really support it. But my TV isn’t 4K anyway, so that isn’t a problem.Some people are complaining about HDCP errors. This is probably because they’re trying to use 4K video on a TV that doesn’t support HDCP 2.2. My five year old TV works just fine, because it’s only 1080p. If you want to see 4K video, make sure your TV really supports HDCP2.2. And you need an HDMI connection that also supports HDCP 2.2. On some TVs that’s only one port.If 1080p24 is important to you, Roku says only the 4K devices can do it. I had to turn it off; when the movie would break for commercials, the receiver usually flaked out. I would have to switch HDMI inputs on the receiver, then switch back to the original. The guide says the screen may flash black; mine mainly went to snow, and wouldn’t recover. So I’m doing without 1080p24. It might work better for people who plug it directly into the TV; I didn’t try that.The specs talk about 802.11ac, but it works just fine on my old router without ac.To set this thing up, look at the Quick Start Guide, or just go to the Roku page about your specific device. Basically I just plugged the stick into an HDMI input, plugged the power adapter into my UPS, and connected the cables. It started right up.I haven’t tried different models, so I can’t offer a comparison. But the Streaming Stick+ works great.First you have to pick a wireless network, and provide the password. Then the stick downloads the latest firmware.When it restarted, mine didn’t connect the first time, even though it indicated it still remembered the password. After sitting for a while with a spinning wheel, it finally gave a 014.40 error, and suggested some alternatives. I just unplugged the power cable and plugged it back in. It restarted, and everything was fine.It will go through a few screens, and give you a four letter code. Go back to the page you end up at after creating your account online, or the page they refer you to. Enter the code, and you’re all set. You can select some channel options. Your stick is now busy setting up channels.And things seem to be working great. It does fine showing a movie in standard definition. It has trouble with the commercials; I wonder if they’re a higher definition. But it gets over it quickly.Things like rewind and fast forward are far better than on my old Blu-Ray player.So far I’m just using things that are free. Look around online at the Roku site, and you can see what’s available.So in summary:This thing works surprisingly well with a slow connection. You don’t get 4K video, but it looks pretty good in old-fashioned 1080p (which is probably really a lot less, as in standard def upscaled to 1080).It works plugged into a receiver that then separates out the audio, and passes the video on to the TV.It works with old routers that don’t have 802.11ac. And it works with new routers that have 5GHz ac.You can create an account without providing any credit card information.I recommend this device to anyone that needs a streaming connection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2018","tz2001",55

"A few more features, and fantastic performance improvement over previous generation Roku","So here is the deal. I already have a Roku Streaming Stick 3600R (2016 version) in our family room. We liked it so much that we wanted our kids to have it for their play area TV, which was closer to the router. Since the family room now needed a new streaming device, I decided to go with the next logical step, the Roku Streaming Stick+ 3810.I am not new to the Roku experience and interface. It was still very snappy. The great content apps were still there. It's basically waiting for me to do a TV upgrade to 4K, which I don't know when it's going to happen. :)I also did discover that I can actually turn on/off the power to my Sony sound bar and also control its volume using only the Roku remote. This makes it very convenient.To feel good about this upgrade, I decided to do several tests related to the temperature, Wi-Fi signal (both using Roku secret menus) and then a speed test using Netflix. I know the Netflix test is not a pure speed test because it uses the Netflix servers, but it's an acceptable indicator for me.Please keep in mind that this is not a scientific test. It's more of a test to check for systematic changes between the two Rokus given other fixed factors. I did all testing within the span of 1-2 hours so I hope no major changes were introduced that affected the tests.Test Configuration (things that did not change during testing): - I did *not* change any advanced default settings in the Roku devices (e.g. interference mitigation, power, etc.) - For audio/video, Roku devices were connected via HDMI to a Sony sound bar HT-CT380, *not* directly into the TV. Both the sound bar and TV support only 1080p, not 4K. - For power, Roku devices were connected to Dish Network Hopper 3 receiver's USB port, which is nice because it is on all the time, whether Hopper is powered on or in standby. - For Wi-Fi, Roku devices were connected wirelessly to a Netgear Nighthawk R7000 (with custom Tomato Shibby firmware) which supports both bands: 2.4 and 5.0 GHz.Test Results*** Roku Streaming Stick (3600) ***Temperature: 74 C2.4 GHz Signal strength: 252.4 GHz Antenna 1: 292.4 GHz Antenna 2: 32Glitch/sec: 385.0 GHz Signal strength: 195.0 GHz Antenna 1: 175.0 GHz Antenna 2: 19Glitch/sec: 32.4 GHz Netflix Connection Speed: 14.87 Mbps5.0 GHz Netflix Connection Speed: 15.63 Mbps*** Roku Streaming Stick+ (3810) ***Temperature: 97 C2.4 GHz Signal strength: 212.4 GHz Antenna 1: 322.4 GHz Antenna 2: 34Glitch/sec: 1775.0 GHz Signal strength: 285.0 GHz Antenna 1: 345.0 GHz Antenna 2: 32Glitch/sec: 02.4 GHz Netflix Connection Speed: 35.58 Mbps5.0 GHz Netflix Connection Speed: 75.13 MbpsConclusions: - Roku 3810 runs about ~30% hotter than the Roku 3600. I hope it's still within acceptable range. I did not receive any warnings or anything during use. - With Roku 3810, 2.4 GHz overall Signal Strength decreased by ~16% compared to Roku 3600. - With Roku 3810, 5.0 GHz overall Signal Strength improved by ~47% compared to Roku 3600. - With Roku 3810, 2.4 Ghz Netflix connection speed improved by an impressive ~139% compared to Roku 3600. - With Roku 3810, 5.0 Ghz Netflix connection speed improved by an incredible ~380% compared to Roku 3600.Comments: - I noticed in one of the tests that the while the Antennas (1 and 2) signal strengths were higher, the overall Signal Strength was lower. Perhaps the overall Signal Strength takes into account other factors such as glitch/sec, interference, etc.? I am not really sure. - Even though 2.4 GHz signal was poorer with the new Roku, I still got faster speeds with Netflix. This tells me that not only the antennas are different, but perhaps the Wi-Fi chipset is improved or something. - In general, using 2.4 GHz band produced way more glitches per second compared to 5.0 GHz, so in my situation, I recommend/prefer using the 5.0 GHz band, especially considering the speed test results in Netflix.Overall, I feel happy about the experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2018","Adam E.",57

I rotate one Roku device between the living room TV and bedroom TV using Century Link DSL (recommended.) I share Showtime and Netflix subscriptions with a friend across town who also uses Roku with Cox Cable - no problems. I have to change batteries about every 4 months.

"Remote does not work on power up","We plug in our Roku streaming stick plus into the USB port of the TV. So, when we put the TV off, the Roku stick also goes off power. When you power on the TV again, the Roku starts up, and now, suddenly the remote stops working. To get it to work, we have to get up, walk close to the TV and point it at the stick just behind the TV. Now it starts working, and will continue to work until the next power cycle. This is unacceptable! What was wrong with the infra-red remote? Worked just fine!Another peeve. I tried plugging the Roku into the wall outlet. So, lets say you're watching an Amazon Prime video, or anything else. You power off the TV, but not the Roku. The Roku continues to stream. This is a no-no. What if you're on a limited internet plan? Also, the cable company is itching to meter our internet, it just needs a justification. Wasteful streaming will provide just such a justification. On the other hand, the Amazon fire stick is smart on this particular issue. It stops streaming, it senses the TV is off.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2019","VJ",59

"Occasionally you find a True Win!! :)","I'm one of those types who hates paying for Cable. My kids, however, want *ONLY* CN and Boomerang; mom ONLY wants Food or Travel Network; etc.. For years I was looking for a way to cut my cable bill - no joy... until today. This looked too good to be true. When I first bought this, I started out disappointed. The video quality was excellent, install easy, no additional Roku hidden fees, connects to Amazon Prime, NetFlix, etc., but when I first hooked it up Thursday, the Roku channels weren't all they were cracked up to be. However, after a little on-line research this morning, I stumbled onto Slack and a HDMI antenna. Signed up on-line for $20/month (+5 per additional channel set) on Slack and broadcast HDTV, I was able to get *all* the channels we normally get through cable! Kids have been watching all morning long and COULDN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE!!! Now I can cut back to basic Internet for $30/month, etc. True happiness. DISLIKES: It's not a seamless experience - you can't pick 'channels' and surf them up and down. The remotes do have jump to buttons for Sling, NetFlix, Hulu, and Vue - just not the same. As an upgrade, I hope they add a 'channel surfing' feature where you can select which channels you want to surf.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2017","Protective Dad",65

"Love love love it!","Who needs cable or satellite especially if you can’t afford it? This is my second Roku streaming stick and I couldn’t be happier. It’s too cumbersome to move my current Roku streaming stick from the living room TV to bedroom TV every time I want to watch one or the other so I snatched this one up for a great Black Friday price. Just like the other one it was a snap to set up and took less than fifteen minutes from start to finish. And that included downloading the 265 channels already in my account. Cheap, endless entertainment for all tastes with much of it free, at a nominal cost or for small monthly fee (like Netflix, etc). Spend as much or as little as you like. Cheap, quick and easy. What’s not to love? One note though: you must have internet and you’ll need the code for your WiFi for set up. Once you enter that code and follow the onscreen instructions you’re done. You have to login to Roku’s website to set up an account and also enter a code that will appear on your TV screen during setup. No worries, it’s all good.

It worked. The Roku stick works great. The Roku interface is the most intuitive....much better than Apple TV (which goes for cool rather than intuitive) or various smart TV interfaces which are generally awful. Roku is able to get all the apps you want. I have yet to find a channel it doesn't get.As to the Ultra, I would avoid it. It works for a while and then out of nowhere it tells you your HDMI cable is not compatible. You need version 2.2. I kept buying new HDMI cables to meet the stated requirements. But it was always the same story. After a while the Ultra would reject my new cable and refuse to show the streaming video I was trying to watch. It did this on YouTube TV, HBO, Showrime and Amazon Prime channels. I changed screen resolution settings, rebooted, reset...nothing worked as the Ultra is a flawed design.So save youself the headache and buy the Roku stick, which works very well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2018","Gadget Man",84

The scammers argued with me, got nasty, hung up on my when I refused them the fee. They said we will activate it for 10 minutes and give you a chance to think it over.

Seeing as our TV in the living room is the furthest point away from the WIFI, there was a very weak signal. CNET stated this product was very good at pulling in the signal and of course the built in features were good as well. As soon as I plugged it in, the WIFI had no problem at all and streaming content didn't have to buffer, along with the quicker downloading.

"Keeps getting worse","This is our 4th Roku, and by far the least reliable and most annoying. It constantly either reboots itself, or (less frequently) randomly factory re-sets itself, thus prompting us to re-download our apps and re-enter username and passwords for everything. This once happened three times in a single week. Sit down to dinner, fire up the Roku and... Roku logo and first-time setup screen again. Ridiculous. And it's not as if the USB power was interrupted as others have suggested. It has its own USB wall outlet, and tried every HDMI port on my TV. The re-booting thing has always existed with Roku devices and, honestly, this shouldn't be an issue after half a decade of supposed 'improvements.' I thought the latest Roku would be a nice alternative to my smart TV's uncontrollable home screen advertising on my Android Sony Bravia, but nope. Both are littered with ads. So what's the point of having multiple streaming devices if they're all spammy and slow? They all suck. It's infuriating that you can't disable the advertising panel on the right side of the Roku home screen, which only seems to recommend extreme right-wing fake news channels like Newsmax, or Tucker Carlson's BS show on Fox. Seriously? Roku should be paying me at this point for all the inconveniences, not the other way around. I don't know if the answer is to try another one, or to switch to a FireStick. Either way, I don't even use my new Roku stick anymore, I unplugged it and stuck it in a drawer and went back to using my smart TV for my streaming subscriptions.*4/15/22 UPDATE*Tried using it again, but the Roku stick doesn't even boot anymore. Hard reset does nothing. Never makes it past start-up splash screen. It's completely bricked. Wish I could get my money back for this POS. I wanna set this thing on fire, film it, and upload the video to YouTube where my hate for this device will live forever. Without a doubt the worst $40+ purchase I've ever made.

"Cheap, faulty remote control","My wife had enjoyed our original Roku unit for several years but had to start unplugging then plugging it in to get it to work. I looked online and thought I would ""upgrade"" to the Roku stick. It showed up promptly (thanks Amazon!) and the installation should have been a piece of cake. It wasn't. The software kept getting stuck on the installation. After power the unit and the tv down and up several times it finally went through. Now we're getting to the sad part.All remotes now a days have 4 directional navigation buttons and the right arrow on this unit wouldn't work unless you pushed REAL hard and repeatedly. Is it too much to ask for a new product to work like its supposed to? This new remote also has a cheaper, thinner non-ergonomic feel to it and is designed to be operated with your thumb. If you have to use your index finger, for instance, when lifting pointing the unit then one of your other fingers will always press the volume mute button. This is simply a bad design.When I use a service or product I think the provider should excel at what they do: a burger joint should make amazing burgers and stop chasing chicken n shrimp, a lamp should light when I press the button and a remote control should be intuitive, easy to hold and operate.

"Roku Product & Support is Terrible","Our old Roku player quit working after about 3 years. It kept giving me a purple screen with error codes. I contacted support and they said that I would need to replace it. I didn't feel that a product working 3 years would need to be replaced, but apparently Roku products do. I figured I would replace it, because I like the Roku Interface and when it worked I didn't really have any issues. We got a new TV, so I figured I would buy the streaming stick+ now that we could enjoy 4k. After a few months the product said it couldn't connect to the internet. When I look at the status of the internet connection it says good. I moved the Roku Streaming Stick+ to the TV next to the WiFi router and still have issues connecting to the internet. When I run the check internet status it says it can't connect. So I had Roku forget the Wifi, and reconnected to the internet. It connected back to the internet and said the connection was good, but then it says I have a weak internet connection again. I contacted support again, and they sent me a HDMI extender, which makes zero sense, because I don't understand how or why a HDMI extender would help with my WiFi connection. I'm reaching out to Roku again, but I'm guessing they will suggest I purchase a new roku product. I will never recommend Roku to anyone, and will never purchase any products from them again.If they won't stand by their products why should I?","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2019","MOzas",117

"720 and 1080 would not work at all with HDCP1.4","I gave this stick 4 stars on the basis of it working with 4K. My Vizio 65"" screen had to small of a indentation where HDMI1 was located for the Roku to fit, so I was temporarily forced to use a side port HDMI4, which only supports HDCP1.4. No matter how hard I tried, or what I set the Roku to for display (tried auto, 720 and 1080) it would bring up everything fine, menus, channels, etc....until it tried play video, in which case, it would purple screen with an HDCP error and emit a loud tone from the TV requiring reboot. This was tried several times, in various ways. Never could get it to work. Once I received my 1.5"" 4K compatable HDMI extension cable, and plugged the Roku into the 4K HDCP2.2 port, then it finally worked after about two attempts with a purple screen. If you are looking for 4K, and have the time to spend tinkering and trying different things, then you may like this. If you have no interest in 4K, or do not have a 4K TV, avoid this one.Added: 7/2018 - After buying a Marantz 4K HDCP2.2 AVR and plugging this into it, along with a 4K Tivo Bolt, everything worked fine and it streamed 4K video from the internet just fine. I attempted to stream a 4K Atmos file from my computer server (i7 with Gig ethernet), and the flle would play about 2 minutes and then fail with an bandwidth error. The file was 12Mb/s video, plus audio. Tried 5GHz and 2.4GHz with same results using the Plex App. Switched to the Tivo, which also has the Plex app, but is hooked up through ethernet, and the file played fine. So apparently, the wireless speed of this device isnt quite up to streaming 4K blu ray quality video (the signal was excellent and the Roku was 2 ft from the router). If I had to do it over, I think I would pay the extra and get the external non-stick HD version, with ethernet connectivity. All in all though, Roku is still the best platform for streaming I have experienced.Update: Unit was only used one or two hours, a couple times a month. Lasted until today, and will now not accept remote control commands from original or new remote. Hitting the trash bin. Save your money and get the better version with a fan. This one overheats badly.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2017","DaveNLR",119

The old one had so many issues with the remote not being recognized, something to do with wifi interference or something. It was so frustrating we hardly ever used it. I finally went ahead and got this since it seemed to be different. And it is! No remote issues whatsoever, it seems to load and do everything faster. I did have to plug it into separate power since the usb output of the TV apparently didn't have enough power. But that's not too big of a deal. The voice recognition works amazingly well.

I bought Roku sticks for my sons and can share log- ins on some streaming services so they have access too, cutting down on costs. The Roku channel itself has tons of great shows and movies. So easy to set up and I'm saving over $100/month vs. cable TV. Should have done this years ago. I got it for my 80 year old mother. It took her a bit to get used too, but now she's flying through the streaming services like a pro. She's delighted with the expanded options and huge cost savings vs her previous cable bill. She has so many program choices, she has spent an hour just looking at what her options are. Never again will she say ""I have all these channels, but there's nothing interesting to watch"" like she did with traditional cable. Great investment, and you can take it anywhere.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2020","CChristian",140

"Horrible Customer Service! Unnecessary device.","I will begin by saying ROKU has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. It is Saturday, I wanted to watch the NFL channel on my ROKU attached to the TV. I downloaded the NFL app. I followed the instructions. I connected to my local TV provider but never once did I see ""the activation code box prompt"" so I could connect. I have tried now at least four times. Ironically, I have been able to turn the NFL onto my IPAD, IPHONE, and computer, but simply not ROKU. Customer service has disconnected be twice, the phone line is impossible. and I have missed the game. this is not the only time i have faced this frustration. I have APPLE TV and an AMAZON fire stick but thought I would try Roku to compare. Customer service is what makes or breaks a company. Spending 60 minutes on a Saturday dealing with your unqualified service is wrong. Your basically a gimmick for NETFLIX and AMAZON and in truth people should just get a smart tv. But before you buy this device, pretend you own a ROKU and go to trouble shooting and see what happens. Nothing.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2018","CHARLES MARLEY",142

"OK for a bit but then extremely slow to respond","I usually do not write reviews, good or bad, but this time I am extremely disappointed. I have owned Roku for years. Unfortunately the quality of the operating system has been deteriorating slowly but surely. I recently purchased two Roku sticks + in order to upgrade from previous models which do not really support 4K - even though they say they do. The sticks worked fine for about 2 months. The last update Roku sent has made them pretty much worthless. Despite my fairly fast internet speed (I get speeds of just over 340 Mbps next to the router where the stick is placed) the stick takes forever to load any App. When I ""check the internet connection via the Roku App, I get little more than 25 Mbps - pitiful!. Amazon has stopped working altogether. Even YouTube is slow and when it finally loads the sound lags behind. I contacted Support and after they could not figure it out the problem (45 minutes) the guy told me to wait a couple of minutes while he ""check on it"" and just disconnected me. I'm switching to Apple TVI have put up with the slowing/deteriorating operating system because the Roku has been always easy to navigate but I feel that they have not cared to keep up with the streaming technology and feel that if I continue to stick with them (no pun intended) I will just continue to feel frustrated and will just waste my money. Time to switch.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2020","Kuya Mig",144

"does not play videos 10 seconds without buffering","I bought this to replace a ROKU 2. Amazon videos play some things. CBS all access, ROKU site, PBS, most all of streaming stations play nothing for more than 5 seconds without buffering. After 3 or 4 buffers, it freezes. Remote also is slow and frequently freezes. I have uninstalled and reinstalled stations, rebooted ROKU, move my router, cut off all devices that share the net,, used a wall outlet for power, disconnected Alexa, My old ROKU 3 had no problems, but was heating up. Connection is rated as fair and speed is rated as good. I have contacted the Amazon support line who offered a new device. I have ordered the extender. If that does not work I will send back. A new device should work better that an old one that cost less. I am afraid that this device is inherently flawed.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2020","Earleen",144

"Think Twice","If you are considering getting a Roku device this information is for you. I got into the “World of Roku” in Sep 2020. Started with the Roku Streaming Stick+ on Sep 8, 2020. Everything was fine for a while but then in December Roku stopped allowing the Spectrum app to download. I then got a Roku Ultra 2020 on Jan 13, 2021 thinking that I could download the Spectrum app on it. Nope. Then a month or so later I could no longer get FoxNews or FoxBusiness. During this 4-month period of time I was slowly understanding what Roku is and how it works. It appears that Roku allows apps like the Charter Spectrum app to download onto the Roku device in exchange for a fee paid by Charter Spectrum to Roku. If Roku asks for an unreasonable fee which Charter Spectrum refuses to pay Roku can block the download of the Charter Spectrum app. If the Charter Spectrum app cannot download on your Roku device, and that includes Roku televisions, you are then unable to view the programs that you used to be able to view. I got fed up with the squabbling. I quit using my Roku Streaming Stick+. I returned the Roku Ultra to the vendor that I bought it from. I then went to my local Spectrum Store and got a Spectrum Cable Box to self-install (and I’m not a tecky). It’s small – about 10 x 10 x 3. It will now cost me $6 per month to have “hassle free” TV. Oh, and by the way, if you try to talk with Roku on the phone you get a recording telling you that due to the Pandemic support techs are not available. The recording directs you to online FAQs etc. Now you decide. Due you want to be the victim of squabbles or do you want easy TV. Your choice. My Roku Streaming Stick+ is for sale on Craigslist and eBay. Nobody wants it. Does that tell you something?","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2021","Moondog",145

"The best streaming stick for your money.","I've had Apple TVs from the first gen to the latest 4k one. For around $50 this Roku Streaming Stick+ is the best option for your money and this supports all current video and audio formats (4k, UHD, HDR, Dolby Atmos etc.). I added this to a Denon AVR-X4400H and it switches on the AVR and TV (Samsung UN65JU7500FXZA) and controls the volume as well. The only 1 remote I need and the only 1 streaming stick I use, although I have Apple TV 4th gen and Samsung Smart interface as well. This has way more apps and choices compared to Apple TV and the only thing this doesn't have is games (which I don't play it on Apple TV anyway).Another reason to get this in a bedroom or guest room is that you can access the Xfinity Stream app and all your subscriptions plus live TV through it rather than paying $10/month for a cable box to Comcast. That's ROI within 5 months. I have this in my main TV set in the living room and in the master bedroom. Also have a cheap TCL Roku TV in the guest bedroom. No issues activating unlike some reviews that mentioned it here while owning multiple Roku devices.Only cons I can think of -1) The voice recognition and search functionality needs major enhancement and doesn't work all that well.2) The remote acts up sometimes and doesn't control the TV/AVR and I have to reset the Roku device (others have mentioned this as well)Overall - I really want to give this 5 stars, 5 stars for the price, 5 stars for the app store, 5 stars for the functionality, 5 stars for formats supported, etc. etc. I'm just taking 1 star away for the minor niggles with remote and universal / voice search.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2019","Inwester",146

"Better experience than the Fire TV stick","My Fire TV stick worked OK for about 6 months and slowly became slower and slower before I tossed it. I wanted a streaming stick with a physical remote control, so it was between a newer fire stick and a Roku.I'm glad I went with the Roku. It feels 3x faster than the Fire Stick and never lags or freezes. I love the fact you can control the TV volume with the Roku remote.The app selection is a bit limited and many 3rd party apps are rough around the edges. I bought this primarily for Netflix and Amazon video, which it plays beautifully.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2017","Sam S.",165

"This would have been pretty great if this was 1997","It has many problems. The biggest problem is that it disconnects from the wifi when I am not using it and then wont reconnect until I reboot it. Forums recommended changing the channel of my wifi so I did that twice and it still loses connectivity. It has full wifi bars.The remote is terribly unresponsive. Sometimes you click a button and it works after a few seconds and sometimes it doesn't. I changed the batteries and it didn't help.It recently started turning off momentarily when I walk around as if something is loose and shorting out.Apps occasionally lock up and it remains unresponsive for minutes.I really want to like this thing but it feels like it was developed by Microsoft in 1997. Yes it eventually does what you want but it seems pretty weird to have such an awful user experience in such a cutthroat competitive market.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2019","Destin P Moulton",166

"Great product! And no you don't have to pay to have more than 2 on your account....","This is a great streaming device and the third Roku that I have so far (still using all 3 just fine) Let me start by first saying that there is a very popular highly trending negative rating from Nov 2018 here on Amazon warning people that if you try to add more than 2 Roku devices onto your account, Roku will insist on starting to charge you for a Premium account (or something.) This is false. The first photo I included here is my account showing all 3 of my Roku devices on my one account, zero charged, still free. So don't believe that review. The only thing i can think of is that maybe the author of the negative review got scammed and clicked on a spoofing/phishing website that tried to scam her out of money. Either way, rest easy, it's false, you don't get charged for having 3 devices and here's your proof. The second picture is my connection to the TV. I used the direct to TV method (powered by TV, not using electrical outlet.) You can see that the Roku itself is plugged in to the HDMI-3 port and the short black power wire is going into the USB port labeled ""USB (HDD 5V 1A)"" just above it. That's it. Easy-peasey. If you have a TV with connections that can support this set-up, it doesn't get much easier. It fired right up, linked right up to the Wi-Fi extender I already had right in the same room. Signal rating is ""excellent."" The third and final picture is the home screen after a few minutes of churning away adding/installing all the apps. All fired up and ready to go now. Very fast and robust navigation from app to app and using the apps. Way faster than my two older ones (Roku-3 from 2013, and Roku Express from 2017) I don't have a big body of work using the voice command remote. It's my first one, the older ones don't have that. I tried it once, I said something like ""Open Netflix app"" and it did just that, brought me right to the Netflix app and opened it. Pretty cool I guess. Granted it's only been a couple days but so far it's been great, as have the other two other Roku units in the house. Overall great deal. Very happy and would not hesitate to recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2020","Jim G.",167

"Roku just isn't what it was","I've owned them since the very first ""roku netflix player"". I've had boxes, sticks, ultras, etc. Maybe 10-12 of them in total over the years.I bought this stick+ for an advertised 3 month CBS all access deal for free, which wasn't much less than I paid for the stick. Humorously, I needed another remote control and the stick+ with remote was $10 more than just the remote.The deal had to be activated by 4/5. Its now 3/31. Won't work. Roku advertised this special offer for months, and still has it on their site, but now it says you have to click through their site to a retailer to get it. It didn't say that last month when I bought it. They refuse to budge.Along the way, I've found their tech support to be bad when it used to be pretty good. I've also had their top of the line Ultra's simply not work properly with my off brand Sony and Samsung tv's (sorry, had to toss out a pun) giving me errors, the remotes stopping working altogether, various streaming issues where I could literally unplug the roku and plug a fire tv 4k box into the same cable and it'd work fine.""Its a problem with your network, cables or tv"".No Roku, you simply make some problematic products these days, have made the activation process onerous (MUST provide name, credit card, address, phone number, birthdate and gender), and you don't honor your deals.Fun part is, those early roku's I bought still worked fine, as did their remotes, albeit very slowly when I checked them out and factory reset them before recycling them a few years ago.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2020","NotADog",176

"Internet Cap from Provider? Want to Stream TV? Be careful.","Recently decided to try and ditch the cable bill and use a tv streaming service (yttv). One big thing to note is that the power button only turns the tv on/off (via IR). If you've got a 1080p stream going and push that power button, you will continue to eat up your internet bandwidth to the tune of up to 50GB/night. I came to this realization a bit too late. All you have to do is be sure to hit the ""home"" button before shutting off the tv. Easy to remember, extremely difficult to put into practice with a revolving door of toddlers and guests accessing the tv.A second option would be to power the device via USB power from the tv, but this means a reboot of the device every time the tv is power cycled - this is far from ideal when considering boot time plus remote pairing time. Far too long for my taste.I much prefer this unit to the fire stick that has screen after screen of Amazon content and no (official) yttv support. The interface is the best I've used on a streaming device (fire stick, roku, shield tv).I'm removing a star based on two things:1) the remote interface for a consumer looking to stream tv. An option to trigger a ""home"" button push with every power button push would be super... or hold the home button for some time to trigger the IR to shut off the tv... Just something to couple those two buttons somehow. Maybe even put the device into a standby mode/home screen based on HDMI CEC when the tv shuts off. I just hate that a tv power button was included on the remote that doesn't function the way a traditional tv power button functions.2) no sound bar volume support. Tvs get flatter, speakers get worse necessitating external sound, and this remote cannot support it. Boo. Fire stick does.Regarding #1, Sure, the tv streaming app could include a timeout option, but the ideal scenario to me is to stop all streaming when I command the display off. Certainly music streamers would not prefer such a feature, so to me, the ingredients lead me to believe this should be an option.Very good product, just not very good for me.I literally cannot afford to use this device to stream tv due to this functionality combined with the occupants of my home.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2019","Erik J.",177

I have no idea where the one customer called to have someone ask for $70 because they had multiple rokus on one account. The instructions clearly point out roku does NOT charge for activating devices so beware of scams. It appears someone tried to scam the customer. Wifi reception was strong and 4K streaming is breath taking. This replaced an older roku device that finally bit the dust.

"Worth every penny","Sorry Fire TV stick. Time to move over and make room for Roku+We cut cable about a year ago and have been using the Fire TV stick ever since. After losing both remotes and having to use the app on our phones to control it, we were getting sort of annoyed. On top of that, the fire tv was so incredibly glitchy and slow, it wasn't even worth it to try to watch anymore. It needed to be unplugged/reset every day.Here comes a Black friday deal on the Roku+ and I have to give it a try.Set up was a breeze. We put it in a room far from the wi-fi router, but it still connected seamlessly with no problems. It is lightning fast when booting up and moving from app to app. Like a night and day difference from the Fire. The included remote is easy to use and I like the volume control that's also included. Plus, it has all the apps we were used to with our old stick - plenty of cable TV streaming apps (ask a generous relative/neighbor for their cable login info and you're good to go) in addition to the Roku TV channel and lots of other content as well.Overall, I am very pleased. I am planning to buy a second one to replace the fire tv stick we had in the other room. The speediness and vast array of content is totally worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2017","Amazon Customer",190

"Works as Described","I purchased this to hopefully bring order to chaos. I have a smart tv. I stream several streaming services, 1 premium pay, and several free. Each streaming service uses my remote differently, and I was hoping the Roku remote would standardize maneuvering the various menus. No such luck. Really, it added another layer of complexity and confusion to what I already have. I have found myself not even using it. That's on me, I should have researched more carefully. The good news is, the Roku Stick + is fast, works every time without glitches. If you have a nice non-smart tv, this can be a huge help. If you already have a smart tv, not so much. I wish all TV manufacturers and streaming services would collaborate to make a more functional remote with universal functions. I guess that won't happen.

It's not just faster...it's FASTER. Loads apps fast! Fast! FAST!My Samsung TV remote doesn't disconnect every other day because the Roku remote controls EVERYTHING.So far, it's only locked up once (thus the 4 stars) as the Fire stick needs to be rebooted (or power disconnected) every other 5 days or so. (I have 5 Fire sticks and they all do that. My boss at work has a few also and he reports the same thing)What I don't like about it (compared to the Fire Stick):More expensive (about $20 more if the Fire Stick is on sale at $29).This review will be updated should anything change.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2020","soaknewe (so can you)",196

"Love Roku","Stuff I like: Super Simple to use, supports 4K with HDR, much faster than previous models, can be plugged into a USB port on the television for power with the included cable, (preventing the need to buy the little $5 stick-to-USB cable to avoid using the AC cord), remote as always is so simple with only a few buttons and this one controls the TV on/off as well as the volume - though I still have four remotes for my TV! :(Stuff I don't like: Does not support Dolby Vision, remote has the sponsered one-touch pre-programmed buttons with channels most of us have no need whatsoever forI do use three streaming platforms on one television - Roku, Chromecast, and Fire Stick.Roku is by far the better of the three and this is my second Roku streamer. The simplicity is what gives Roku the edge over the others. Even though I've only used the iPhone app for my pre-existing Roku, the included remote is simple with only a few buttons and no clutter. I do wish the ""included pre-programmed"" buttons, like the one-touch Netflix, Sling, Hulu, and Vue, (what the heck is VUE???) buttons were not there and instead we were given the option to add our own one-touch favorites instead of letting those companies pay Roku for the privilege. It's just wasted space on the remote, except maybe for Netflix. Roku could have used one of those buttons for a much needed mute button for the volume.My favorite for supporting Roku over the others, and I'm sure many agree, is the extremely simple home screen. Many web review sites say it could be called ""dated"" but in this case, it's welcomed and Roku's biggest asset. It's too simple and attractive. My favorite positive Roku has over the others is there is little to no bias whatsoever on the home screen as the others can add so much clutter, advertising, and pushing their sponsored marketing stuff on you. I also like the idea that I can plug the power for the stick directly into an unused USB port on the TV to avoid using the included AC power cord and adapter. Our TVs today have enough unsightly wires in the back from stuff as it is!My personal biggest negative with the Roku Streaming Stick + is it does not support Dolby Vision, only HDR10. I can't figure Roku out on this, the days of regular 4K are far behind us and a televison without both HDR10 and Dolby Vision should ** never ** be considered if you're really into televison specs and display quality. Thankfully my Vizio supports both Dolby Vison and HDR10 on Chromecast. The lack of Dolby Vision is why I gave this review 4 stars instead of 5. It would be nice if the remote would control my Vizio's input options in addition to the volume and power on/off buttons allowing me to put my Vizio remote away.Overall, for the price, quality, and features, this is an excellent streamer I highly recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2017","Aubin",196

"Worked great . . . for 6 months.","Same issue as many others apparently... out of the blue, six months in, nothing talks to the device anymore. Runs red hot within only a couple minutes too.I'm honestly now convinced that Roku streaming devices, and their remotes, are too flimsy and janky to justify buying, and that the ""savvy consumer"" would be well advised to spring for something a little more sound.Had to replace the remote that came with it to see if that was the issue, and then of course had to return the replacement after that TOO failed to pair... at which point I walked into an amazing discussion with an Amazon rep trying to ""solve my issue"" by teaching me how to use the Roku app. as a remote instead -___- at which point it HAD been made clear that I was trying to return this thing for a refund after it out-of-the-box failed to function...So if you're following, the rep. was trying to prevent a refund for a defective item by teaching a customer how to use a different item instead. Brilliant.After 30 min. the refund was agreed to WITHOUT requiring a USPS pick-up, which was odd, and when they agreed to the refund they also said something to the effect of ""because you're a valued customer..."", which was ALSO odd hahaha shouldn't it just be ""because that thing you bought no work..."" ?Ultimately it was fun watching AdultSwim on this cheap toy while it lasted, but now I'll probably have to purchase a more solid competing device and toss this thing altogether :(","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2020","MadMycoMike",202

"Ok","Let me start out by saying that I am fine with the picture and audio quality, but I am not all about that to begin with, so I may not be the best judge of it. I installed this on a TV we don't used very often. My issue is that when I turn it on, it freezes at the screen saver, the volume up and down works, but I can't get to the TV, Netflix or anything. I have to turn it off and on, sometimes unplug it because it is frozen and won't do anything. I just turned the sound off for the button because I read that could cause it, but I just did that, so not sure if that is a good fix. When it works, it is great. I will update in a few weeks.I was going to wait to update, but I just got so frustrated trying to get this thing to work I had to downgrade my rating. I have tried everything to get this thing to work. I restarted it, unplugged and restarted it multiple times, and no luck. There are a lot of people having issues like I am having, just do an internet search on Roku freezing.Okay, after trying for 45 minutes to get this to work I found a website that said to refresh the remote. I had no clue I would have to wipe the remote clear and then pair it again with the stick. Finally working, but it will be interesting to see how often I will have to do this.Absolute junk!!!!!!!!","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2019","Traveler",204

"Roku will decide which apps you get to use","I put Roku sticks on all of my Samsung ""smart"" TVs because I was sick of dealing with slow updates and lack of apps. My apps on Roku are kept up to date, but they still don't get all the features that Android TV devices get. I have 5 Rokus, an Amazon Fire Stick, TiVo Stream, Apple TV, and Chromecast. I went with all Roku because their apps are the most up to date and the user interface is easy. After playing around with the Fire Stick and TiVo (both Android), I've found that those apps are just as up to date or more and I can side load any app I want.Roku and YouTube are in a heated battle right now and it looks like Roku might block YouTube because they can't come to an agreement. I don't want a device that leverages its large user base to force providers into contracts. I'm not a fan of the user interfaces on TiVo or Fire Stick, but at least they don't block me from side loading apps that aren't in the app stores.My advice to you is to find a pure Android TV device. They aren't locked down to weird interfaces like Amazon & TiVo and they won't ever block you from putting any app you want on them. They might cost a little more up front because they aren't making more off of you with tons of ads, but in the long run, they don't play politics and they don't have a say in which apps you get to have access to.I'll try to remember to update this when I find a good Android device. I've heard really good things about Shield, but it's pretty expensive to add to ask of my TVs.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2021","Mr. Mike",208

"Unit Failed in 6 months, worst customer service ever","The unit quit working after 6 months. Could not sync the remote to the stick. After troubleshooting with the tech by phone it was determined the unit was bad and an RMA warranty was issued. The unit was returned by Express Mail and arrived within four days of the RMA being issued. Then a whole series of canned emails began, most ending with the question had this been resolved. I kept answer4ing no, not until a replacement unit was shipped. More canned emails. After about 10 days of this I was able to locate a customer service phone number (not on Roku’s website) and called them. I was told the status was they have the RMA, it takes about 10-14 days to ship a replacement depending on the warehouse but that I would b e getting a replacement soon. This seems to be ridiculous amount of time for a warranty replacement. A week later I get an email requesting a tracking number for the original return. Well I had been in temporary quarters for several weeks and had now relocated and frankly did not store the USPS receipt safely as Roku said they had received the unit. Called Roku again and explained all of this to an agent who spoke poor English. Said he would do nothing without a tracking number. Asked to speak to someone who could resolve issue or to a supervisor. The agent just kept repeating without the tracking number he would do nothing and would not allow me to speak with anyone else. I finally gave up. I will now go with Amazon Fire-stick. This is the worst customer service I have ever encountered in either my professional or consumer roles.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2019","Kindle Customer",208

"Works Fine","I've been using the Wii for about ten years, but they got rid of YouTube a few months ago, and now are getting rid of Netflix, so it's useless technology unless you have old games. The Roku is great for streaming, and no, you do not need to add a credit card as others have mentioned. You only need to add steaming services that you already have, OR use the free channels, as there are several.The Talk to Search is really awesome on the remote control, but it doesn't always recognize what you are saying. The downside is that it only searches all of Roku, not specific channels. For example, if you search YouTube for ""90's Music,"" it will search the Roku channels for it. You can't search within the channel itself using the voice option. It also doesn't always understand very well, even when you're speaking clearly. You can keep repeating it and nothing will populate, but then when you type to search, what the Roku just said was not there by voice, suddenly appears. Very glitchy.There are times that it will freeze on the home welcome screen as well, but turning it off and on helps. Overall, those are the only complaints I've encountered.

"Frustrating...","Let me say that I have 2 other Roku's that are fantastic and have never had any issues with them. Bought a new TV in July and was excited about the fact that Roku makes this stick that can handle 4K and HDR. Over the past 5 months my excitement has faded. I, like several others, get the HDCP warning on a regular basis and the worst part is that it happens when I'm trying to load non-4K apps. After calling Roku customer service in November they sent me an HDMI extender, which did absolutely nothing. Recently there is a new issue...the remote keeps un-pairing from the Roku. Customer service has finally agreed to replace it since it's still under warranty but I must pay shipping to return the defective one to them. The two stars applies to the device and their customer service.UPDATE 6/5/19 - downgraded to one star due to the fact that the replacement Roku is just as bad as the original. It also has a whole new set of issues including constantly losing connection with my network, unpairing from the remote which doesn't work half the time, audio issues, and failing for no apparent reason...and once in bright red letters on the screen was a message saying the Roku was overheating...unplug it! I have come to know not to wait until the show I want to watch is starting because it can take up to 20 minutes of restarting/repairing to get the thing to work. I'll be throwing this out & replacing with something else. It's junk & I do not want to deal with Roku ""customer service"" again.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2018","louisville",221

"Horrible customer support and terrible software","If you get one but already have another, whatever you do don't 'Add' the new one to your account. Use another email address and user name.I've bought several and on one of the units I wanted to remove Hulu from an older unit that no longer was compatible with Hulu. After I had done that I discovered that Roku had removed Hulu from ALL the other units, including one at the vacation house.I've found that even if you are directed to remove a misbehaving App before installing it, it also wipes the app off any other Roku's that didn't need to reinstall.Roku customer service is useless, no way to reach them and emails go unanswered. To even get into your account you are forced to deal with the most annoying machination of the computer age, reCaptcha! I have dropped blog accounts that require it.Why are all the streaming device companies worse than the cable companies we are trying to escape?","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2020","John is Gone",223

"Bad design","1. Bad design: the stick’s form makes it impossible to connect directly to the hdmi port on my tv (which is a brand new, latest model Vizio) since the stick is too big to fit in/around the two different locations behind the tv that have hdmi ports ......the stick is too long to get into the port/connection well behind the tv.2. Overheating : the device overheats and becomes unusable. I don’t have it in an enclosed space or on top of any other electronics....I had to get an hdmi extender and the device is laying out in the open with plenty of air around it. Even then it becomes hot and unusable after a few days. I have to unplug it after using it. Also the power cord is ridiculously short - so either have to use a power cord extension or have to have it laying down/hanging near the power outlet/strip.I am very frustrated with this device. Who designed this junk?!? I’m very surprised by the absolute lack of effort and intelligence that went into this product. Don't they do any FMEA on design and alpha/beta testing?? My earlier roku was way better and well designed.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2019","F. Khalil",224

"Didn't work for me.","Amazon stopped supporting Prime Video on my Panasonic Plasma and my Sony Blueray player. I needed a new way to stream. Roku looked like the answer.Roku did not work for me. I purchased three of these in a month. The first one activated in minutes and streamed perfectly for about three weeks. Didn't understand the bad reviews. Then it stopped streaming completely after three weeks. Network was fine. Sent back two days before return window closed.The second one hung up for hours trying to activate. It logged on to my network fine, but It would not finish the activation screen. It gave me the activation code to finish, but before I could enter it, Roku kept giving me a new code. Returned it also.Third one, same as the second one. I've had it with Roku.The first one streamed fine for three weeks, then died. It seems it's hit or miss with Roku.Guess I'll have to try a Fire Stick.Update: Purchased a FireStick 4k after sending back the third Roku.The FireStick was up and running in about ten minutes. It's fast and so far no issues. Also, it's nice to be able to skip intros and ads with the firestick.

Hmmmm....Turns out it was the batteries. So I installed new batteries. Rinse, repeat.After going through 4 set of batteries in each device over a 6 week time period--and I don't use the Roku remote everyday. nor do I play a headset through the remote or do any video games--I got on Google and discovered there are thousands and thousands of complaints about these remotes gobbling batteries like candy. Roku IS aware of this issue. They will honor their warranty but want me to pay for return postage. Really?

"UPDATED INFO - VERY POORLY IMPLEMENTED. Would not recommend.","WAY TOO MUCH back and forth from computer to tv and back. Registration is obtuse. Would not allow registration to complete unless I added CC. I do NOT make purchases, so this is useless and just another way for ROKU to intrusively capture your information. Also added channels I did NOT want: DISNEY, HULU, HBO, SHOWTIME, etc.The only reason I purchased was for viewing YouTube. That's it. I have been using a Samsung DVD/BluRay device, the the YouTube performance was VERY BAD. Continuously stalls for YouTube but works good for NF and AP. This device works VERY well for YT, but the setup is a turn off. The juice is just not worth the squeeze. If I had it to do again, I would not buy this.One more thing... the extender cable I needed had to be ordered thru Roku. BACK ORDERED for ONE FULL MONTH. I went out and purchased one retail. Another poor selling point. For the price, it should be included. ROKU is just ""Cheaping Out"".Do Not Buy... or do so at your own peril.UPDATE: The EXTENDER CABLE is NOT A CABLE, BUT A CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP ""dongle"" appx 3 inches long. AND IT DOES NOT, I REPEAT, IT DOES NOT WORK. I plugged it into my SAMSUNG TV, and the screen does not display correctly... looks like lines on the screen.

"Product, website, and support is awful.","Shame on me for letting this product sit around for a couple of months before I got around to installing it. Decided to do this on Dec 6th, 2020 on a rainy day. Instructions make it look easy. And it was at first.....long story short, when going through the setup of the product you enter an e-mail address that sends you an activation link. First time failed? Second time was a success. Went through the process and got the congratulations page. Sitting on the TV was the page that simply showed my e-mail th link would be sent to and a * option that gave yo the option to reset the device. Also, it stated the link would expire in 15 minutes. Ok. Great. I completed the process as stated above and finished out.........now what? Page is still shown on the TV stating it would send me a link. Do I turn it on and turn it off. The * option, just gave me options to reset the deive to factory defaults or restart the device. So, I cut it off vis the power button on the remote and upon starting back up it either goes back to the page showing a link will be sent or starts the process all over again. It's stuck in a loop. What's worse is the website sucks too. Go to the roku support website and it asks for the category of support needed and then the model number and...........no continue button, no page refresh for that model, nothing. Page just looks like it was not finished by the developers. How could it suck this bad? Oh, and if you finally find the Roku support number you get a recording saying they no longer offer phone support due to Covid-19. They don't offer chat support either. Looks like I will have to choose another product to cut the cord. Obviously for Roku to be aorund as long as they have they have got to have some good products......or just nose dived and started sucking hard on Dec 5th 2020 or somewhere around that time frame. Anyway, that is my experience. Still going to try a few things. I'll post if I make progress.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2020","Jay Reed",229
"Streaming Stick + Eats Remote Batteries in a Week if Unplugged","I have one of these Streaming Stick + that works. It’s stays “on” all the time; it is powered on all the time.I bought a second one and the tv powers the USB port off when it turns off.The batteries die in the remote in about 5-6 days. I have been through 5 or 6 pairs of batteries in a couple of months. It’s awful.Roku support is unhelpful. They followed up twice with a long questionnaire about the issue but they don’t follow up any more after this, and I answered their questions in detail.I have had made 4 attempts through chat and email to resolve the issue, and have now given up. And I never leave bad reviews. Others should be warned about this situation, though.Roku told me to keep the device plugged in, basically, and never responded again even though I have reached out three more times.IMHO they don’t have an answer and blew me off.The issue is documented on a Reddit thread I found so there are others with this issue even though Roku denies it.I believe other units will work in this situation (needing the roku to be powered off when not in use), so you can get other Rokus. Skip the streaming Stick + with the voice remote. It’s not good unless you want to use your phone as a remote or love buying or recharging batteries every week!","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2021","J",229

"Problem With Device and Poor Customer Support; Roku Does Not Horror Their Warranty","I have owned several Roku streaming devices during the past and have never had any issues with the devices. However, the Streaming Stick+ is a different story. Very often, the stick freezes up and is totally unresponsive. The only way I have found to get it working again is to unplug it and wait 60 seconds. I contacted customer support via Chat and the representative was of no help. He told me he would send troubleshooting steps to correct the problem via my email but I never received them. I then called customer service's phone number and waited almost an hour but was never able to speak with a representative. I was unable to find any troubleshooting solutions to this problem on line. If this is the best Roku can do, I'm switching to Fire Stick.Update: After communicating with Roku's Technical Support via emails for two weeks, I still have not resolved the problem with my Streaming Stick+. It still freezes up several times a day and I have to unplug it for 60 seconds and then restore power to reboot. Even then, it does not always work and I must reboot several more times to get it going again. Customer Service is TERRIBLE. It appears that the Tech may be overseas and using a language program to translate based on the tech's poor grammar and misspelled words. Also, you can forget about the one year warranty! They are quick to blame the problem on everything except their device and will not consider replacing the device. My advice is to avoid purchasing the Roku Streaming Stick+.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2019","G. Green",230

"Good streaming player, lots of sports and movie choices, but the remote control is TERRIBLE!!!","I think the ROKU system is awesome, but the Streaming Sticks interface to the remote control is horrible with useless voice command capability. I have had the Streaming stick for almost a year. When the remote works it is good, but that is rare. The original remote control started going bad after about 4 months. I asked ROKU to send me another one and they did. And it is going bad also, or I thought. And then I looked up REMOTE CONTROL ISSUES on Streaming Stick and found there was an extender HDMI cable they will send you for free to fix the remote response lagging issues supposedly caused by the Streaming stick being plugged directly into your HDMI port. I though awesome, maybe now I won't have to wait up to 5 minutes for the remote control to respond to a button push. The cable came after about 4 or 5 days, and I tried it right away. IT MADE IT WORSE!!!!!. I gave it three days and it did not get better. Worst remote control I have ever had on any TV. And I am 60 and have used countless TV's and remote controls. I had to start using the ROKU remote control app on my Samsung Smart Phone. Response is great on the app, but a remote without buttons that you have to look at every time you want to change the Channel or fast forward past commercials sucks. SO.... I am sending it back before my year warranty is up. I am going to try the top of the line Roku ULTRA. If that doesn't work, I think I will be going back to Dish Network. Best remote I have ever used on the Dish system.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2021","equakeman",230

"Sooooooo many glitches","I've been using a Roku stick since the beginning of streaming days and never had an issue other than the odd random restart.Recently our YouTube app started acting crazy, and since our daughter loves YT and there was a big sale on this product I decided to just buy a new one.Man- I can't tell you how many issues I had with this stick in the 5 hours I had it working.-remote kept unpairing-""low power"" message at least 5 times when it was plugged into the outlet- having to restart it-randomly audio would go out- screen would freeze (thankfully Roku remote app saved us)Husband was so frustrated he just gave up on watching football Sunday on the tv.I tried resetting it twice (putting in all my info which was a headache) and still same issues.Sending this back real quick","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2021","mayg19",232

Then is start freezing up and none of the buttons on the remote would function at all. I changed the batteries, but that made no difference.

I bought it and returned it , bought it again and the second one still reaked of mold and mildew like it had been stored in a damp place for ages. Since all the parts are plastic I doubt if it will ever get better. I washed the remote with bleach but it did not take the smell away. I think it's just permanently imbedded in the plastic. I'm afraid to return it again since the next one might just be the same problem; and it's so inconvenient to have to keep signing in to everything over and over again with a new one. I haven't even received the refund for the first one I sent back yet either so I'm kind of waiting to see what happens with that before I return this one again to avoid any confusion.

"Love Roku - it is free after buying the device","We use Roku in every room of the house here, it is a great thing. We purchased a couple of these for the not-so-smart TVs and this brings them right up to speed with our more modern TVs that have Roku built in. For those that comment about needing to pay activation fees or setup fees - your doing it wrong... The only thing you pay for is your own subscriptions to netflix/hulu/paramouont+/disney+ ect. but we also use loads of free apps like pluto, tubi, Plex & locast (local channels)... Roku is free, don't fall for the scammers on the internet lol. I do believe though however, outside of the USA has some restrictions on the apps that are available. If you live outside of the USA I would setup an account on the roku website first and see what is available. They determine what apps are available in your country/region when u first create your account on the website (hint for those that r smart) (but if you live in the USA everything will just work great right out of the box).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2021","C.A.",243

"A Great Device Unless You Need Help","3rd Roku, so I thought I knew what I was doing. This particular one comes with NO instructions whatsoever. At first, it seemed fine, though a picture of the connections is critical for new users. But this one only let me set up the network and then thought it was done, giving me some weird options. I dug deeper and found another user name associated with my device. I knew this was wrong. If anything weird happens to you (and this is NOT documented on Roku's site), go to the device attached to your HDMI port. Using a flashlight, you'll find an almost invisible button. Push and hold for 10 sec. This is a factory reset. When you do this, it should walk you neatly thru the setup process and all will be good. But how would you know? This should be a. part of the package insert - basic instructions are key. and b. on the website. I went everywhere trying to find an answer and finally did a chat. It took quite a while as the people answering appear to think you had info and that you understand their poorly worded advice. Once setup, it is a great little thing and much better than any Roku that has a separate little box. That one was always a problem for me.

"Don't Waste Your Money","That the cable they include did not fit my older TV was less of a problem than not being able to speak with customer support for two major problems. The set-up kept failing by not recognizing my WIFI, the router for which, in perfect health, sat in the same room. This went on for days while the Roku team sent me condescending emails with long lists of what I had to do to make their unreliable hardware work. I eventually solved the problem by ignoring it and trying again seven days later without doing any of the things on their long list. As I relaxed with Netflix, the Roku CS team kept sending me emails and finally called me. Do any of you answer calls from unknown numbers? Not enough time in the day. More email tag ensued, during which time the Roku stick again malfunctioned. Out of the blue - no one bumped into the TV stand or jostled the stick. There were no electrical surges or WIFI problems. Just cut out in the middle of a movie. Bad engineering or poor quality control, take your pick. Do they think this will motivate me to update my TV?

"Flexible and easy to use streaming device. Highly recommend.","Very impressed with these. We now have them on four televisions at home. Good choice of streaming providers (many free) and very flexible. If you do subscribe to a paid service through the Roku device, the billing is handled correctly. If you are already subscribed directly with a paid service, the authentication by Roku works correctly. Search feature seems to work well across multiple channels. We have not used the voice recognition feature. The Roku remotes have paired well with three different brands of television (on/off, volume, etc.) and are easy to use. Reliable WIFI connections are maintained. While all our televisions are ""smart"", the Roku wireless connection seems to have less latency issues than some televisions, and Roku has a wider choice of services than some smart tvs. We have found it very helpful to have the single Roku menu and command scheme on all our televisions. This results in way fewer clicks to get where you want to go and less confusion when you sit down in front of different televisions. (The television remote overrides the Roku, so it's east to switch back and forth if you need to.) The only small downside we have noted is that the Roku remotes seem to eat batteries more quickly than other devices. Overall a slick and reliable tool.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2022","Tom L.",246

"Solid Performance but Poorly-Designed Remote","I'm a pretty tech-savvy cord-cutter and until very recently I was using my laptop with an HDMI cable as my streaming device. I got tired of this cobbled-together solution and decided to try a streaming device. I looked into Chromecast and Fire Stick before purchasing this Roku. I really wanted to like the Chromecast with Google TV because I am already very Google-centric, but the combination of price, the rich selection of apps, and the streamlined interface sold me. I rarely use voice commands in the home because it disturbs family members, and I also don't use a smart home device such as Alexa or Google Nest.My only real CON is a large one: I really hate the remote, and having a dedicated remote was one of the reasons I was getting sick of using my laptop. First off, NO BACKLIGHT. Why this feature isn't standard on remote controls these days is beyond me. If there was a backlight, I wouldn't have nearly as big a problem with the key and button layout. Every TV and cable remote control I've ever owned (and I'm 57 years old) has had a (more or less) standard layout, and I've NEVER had a remote with volume buttons on the side. That is a phone feature! And the four favorite buttons for Netflix, Disney+, hulu and sling are at the very bottom, where I expect to find navigation such as play and pause. So I'm constantly trying to pause a video and instead launching one of these four premium services, of which I subscribe to NONE. (Why isn't one of them Amazon Prime Video? And why can't I customize them?) And none of this would bother me nearly as much if there wasn't a BLANK SPACE 1-1/4"" square UNDER the four favorites buttons.So I would take the middle tier of buttons and move them to below the favorites, and put the volume and mute buttons where they belong - in the middle of the remove.OK I'm done.

"I can't tell you what I like about it because I can't use it","I can't tell you what I like about it because I can't use it.The HDMI port on my TV doesn't allow for the long Roku stick to plug in directly and Roku doesn't include the small wire adapter that allows this as part of the standard packaging. You have to go online to order a free adapter that'll make it work. Ok, so that's a bit irritating. I have this device that I already waited on and now I need to wait for snail-mail to deliver an adapter. Fine! I guess I have no choice.So online I go and fill out my name, email address, shipping address and super long serial number. Press submit and wait for my confirmation. NOPE! Sorry! they're temporarily out of stock on this 3 penny item. I mean, really? You don't a bazillion of these laying in piles since they cost nothing and are a critical component to many customers? But that's not irritating enough, do you think they'd take your order and ship it whenever it becomes available again? NOPE! They simply trash your order (after saving your email for marketing I bet) and expect you to come back day after day after day, fill in ALL your information again, re-submit your order and just to hope that Roku has gotten around to replenishing the critical 3 penny Item.Ridiculous!Utter lack of customer service and lack of respect for end users time.They can 'stick' it (get it? :-) I'm sending it back!","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2017","copb8",247

"Terrible product and support","This is my second Roku. The first one came with a service I purchased and quit working after 3 months. I kept seeing the great reviews and got a good price, so decided to try it again. What a mistake! At first, I couldn't get any channels because it was confusing my new device with the old one that was FOUR YEARS OLD! They told me I would have to use a different email account to set up the device. After about 30 minutes of telling them this was ridiculous, I will just return it, they finally got a supervisor to intervene to fix my account. Bad luck on my end, because I should have just returned it. About four days ago, all my channels just randomly disappeared except for Netflix. I can't add any channels either through the device or on my computer. Tech support said they would contact me but it has been four days and nothing. Going back to using the Firestick. See photo above for the dead link you get after you select the product to get customer support. Do you see a way to proceed?

"Mighty convenient, missing important power-user features.","I have very high expectations for my audio/video gear. When streaming audio or video, I am used to using a home theater PC connected to my TV via a receiver. This is fantastic for most things, but it isn't very convenient or easy to use. Additionally and unfortunately, many streaming apps for Windows don't support the highest level of audio or video quality, which is very frustrating.To solve the convenience, ease of use, and quality problems, I purchased one of these. And the Roku Streaming Stick+ is very convenient (small, easy WiFi connectivity), easy to use (great interface), and allows me to stream high quality from apps like Netflix and Disney+.However, there are a few major problems with this piece of gear:1. Ads. I hate that there are ads littered about the Roku interface. Come on.2. No advanced features such as A/V sync offset. For some reason, audio in certain Roku apps is out of sync from the video. Neither my receiver nor my TV have options for modifying this sync - usually, I just change that setting per-application on my HTPC, and I'm happy. But there exists no such setting on Roku, which makes certain content unwatchable.3. The first copy of this piece of hardware I got from Amazon was dead on arrival and wouldn't turn on. I returned that Stick and purchased a replacement.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2020","Zach Fox",248

This time I was told to get an adapter to fix the problem, which did nothing. I contacted roku again today about this problem but because it’s been over a year they will no longer pay for a new remote.

"Happy but could be better","Just been using Roku stick plus for a week and need time to get use to it from cable remote. The first day even plugged to wall outlet, I got insufficient power message. I chat with customer service and she was very helpful. I unplug from tv and let it charge for 15 mins. That was it and now it's charging through tv usb without the message. The stick is warm, but I think that's normal. For tv, I subscribe to Directv Now. I have to scroll through the channels and can't type in channel numbers like I use to. I can't use voice command to change channel either, Roku will take me out of live tv and open a corresponding App to that channel instead. Roku app doesn't allow me to change channels at all while watching tv. It would also be great if it has a mute button.My Roku came with remote with different short cut keys than shown: Netflix, Hulu, Sling, and Vue. I rather have one with NOW as shown.The good? Savings of 50% on cable, our household watches 16 channels but we need a package of 220 channels from Xfinity to get all the 16 that we watch regularly.

"Roku has lost me as a customer.","I purchased this item a year ago and gave it 5 stars at the time--mainly for picture quality and improvements over their original model. But Roku has now lost me as a customer. After a year of their ridiculous channel selection system (about a dozen clicks to get from start screen to a program), I tried to watch a program tonight on CBS All Access (now Paramount+) and found Roku had logged me out of that channel. The device/system would not accept my account and password for that channel, even though it works on the new Paramount+ website. I went to Roku.com to advise them of the problem, and I hit the wall they'd built to avoid their customers. After selecting the closest non-relevant option they offered, I got this message--for a device I bought just a year ago! ""Agent-assisted support is not available for your issue and/or model."" Roku offers no online support other than ""ask the community,"" no option to e-mail them--just nothing.

Also, it's very easy to add new channels such as Disney+ and HBOMAX, but after a full month of use here are my not-so-good impressions. 1.) The controller does the job but I wish it had additional features such as switching back to the previous channel with the touch of a button. Performing this task is a bit awkward and requires several button clicks. 2.) Thus far we've already replaced the batteries after one month. 3.) For some reason the volume control will suddenly cease to function. I found that if I unplugged the fob in the TV, thus rebooting it, the volume function returned. Weird.

"Not for channel surfers","After having Directv satellite for 18 years at my house (which I loved despite the breaks during storms), I called customer service because monthly price has gone from $92 to $163 in the past year, but they refused to discount any further so time to say goodbye to Directv. After some research I decided on Youtube TV. Next it was looking for a streaming device. I am a channel surfer so quickness navigating between apps and programs to stream was of high importance. I have an Asus RT-N66U router and Spectrum 100MB cable internet so bandwidth shouldn't limit me. I first tried the streaming Stick + from Roku which gets glowing reviews. I connected it via my 5G wireless (in the next room about 8' away from the TV) and it was very sluggish and reported a slow internet connection. Doing a connection test in the ROKU reported 1Mb/s though the laptop on speedtest on the same wireless reported 54Mb/s. I've had spotty coverage in the house with the 5G wireless so I switched to the slower and Roku was then happy with the porformance showing nearly what the laptop did.Pros - I like the Roku menus, DVR setup, layout, and the simple remote... Using a Panasonic Plasma 1080P, the picture is excellent with absolutely no complaints. I didn't test anything with soundCons - What I don't like is the latency when switching among apps or when kicking off a stream. Seems to buffer for about 8-10 seconds before the program starts playing. I'm guessing this is buffering because if I compare what is streaming for a local channel to antenna input on the TV for the same channel, the Roku was about 8-10 seconds behind. I have Youtube TV, Amazon Prime Video, and Netflix with the slowness the worst with Youtube TV. I also don't like that you can't set a particular app to automatically run on startup.At less than one third the cost of Directv, I'll stick with it but it feels like going backwards in performance... like if you had to get rid of the SSD in your Core-I7 laptop for a slow hard drive.Note that I moved the streaming stick + to the bedroom TV and got a Roku Ultra for the main TV. This time connected to ethernet and Roku reporting 78 Mb/s or better. While the performance is slightly better, it still doesn't have the quickness I'd like. I'll keep watching reviews for something better...","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2019","R. Perry",255
"Sooooo disappointed from a long time Roku customer","I strongly advise against buying this streaming stick. I replaced my older Roku stick with this SS+ thinking it will be faster while also having a stronger Wifi antenna. When I first installed it I was not disappointed. It worked great...for about 2 weeks. Out of nowhere it would not play a single video from any streaming service, displaying a ""HDCP error"" and advising me to unplug it and plug it back in. Well that didn't work. I did a 'system reset'. Nope. I changed the display type and dropped the resolution down to 780p. Nope. It even said HDCP compliant on the display type! I went to the Roku forum and saw hundreds of other customers having the exact same problem - it worked for a while and then suddenly the HDCP error out of nowhere. Some said it would go away for a while and then come back intermittently. For many others like myself nothing worked. I sense there is a firmware issue that Roku refuses to acknowledge. Customers called into Roku only to be disconnected. They said the customer service was horrible. I'm returning it and buying the Amazon Stick. Until Roku admits and addresses the problem I am done with them. This is a big black eye for Roku.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2019","Robert York",255

"I'm happy with this purchase","This is my third Roku device purchase, and it's the best one I've had so far. The Roku ""box"" and Roku ""stick"" I bought many years ago served their purpose, especially at a time when I didn't own a Smart TV, and they were both donated or given away.I imagine most HD TVs sold nowadays are also Smart devices with integrated software and streaming apps (such as Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, HBO Max, Disney+, etc.). One thing that was missing from my Samsung 65"" 4K Smart TV was the new Paramount streaming app, which I needed to watch new Star Trek shows formerly streamed by CBS All Access.Roku Stick+ has the streaming services I like, including Paramount and The Great Courses Plus, and in Ultra HD. The voice remote also works better than my Xfinity's.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2021","Gryff94580",256

"Plug and play!","I really love this unit. So easy to use and the microphone feature is wonderful. Just press it down and speak into it, and it will take you to what you want. At the very least it's a good start. This model is easy to hook up and get started. Just plug the Roku stick, which looks like flash drive with a power cord attached, to a USB port. There's a quick-start guide with all the details. When you search for a movie or TV show, it lets you know where it's available, starting for free if possible and moving up in cost. I like this way of doing it.Also bought a different Roku one for my mom, who is stuck home and wanted to stream different shows. Easy to set up as I said, but to get started, they send a code to your computer and you have to enter your name, address, gender and birthdate. Also your credit card should you choose to get pay-per-view content, I guess. A lot of information needed, and I never trust these companies keeping it private. When they asked me for mine, I just hit the LATER button. You can always change settings on these things.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2020","D. Bratman",259

He called to tell me what happened and I knew something was wrong since roku never charges to activate and set up! I did a factory reset and everything went normally after that.

"Overheats even when tv is off- Returned it","After installing this Roku to my television, occasionally my tv would turn off. I had no clue why. Then 2 weeks into using this device the tv turned off again and I was wondering why, so I immediately began checking the connections. I felt the Roku hdmi connection and it was hot to the touch so I unplugged it to cool it down. Then later reconnected it. I returned it-My final straw was, after the tv was off all night, I decided to check the Roku connection and make sure it wasn’t hot but it was. Even while the tv was off all night! There was nothing interfering with breath ability for the device.My Amazon fire stick doesn’t overheat like this, even while the tv is off- so I’m replacing this Roku stick with an Amazon cube. We have an older Roku streaming device (express model;about 4yo) on another tv in our home and it doesn’t over heat. Besides the overheating, I enjoy Roku. There are many apps available. I was really liking the new remote.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2022","Sea",261

"my journey to 4k hdr 60hz with a sony tv, yamaha surround sound receiver and this roku stick","Ok. This is going to be long…but maybe something through my experience will help you solve something faster than me.I ended up with the Sony x800g 75” led 4k UHD HDR10 tv.Lots of numbers there. And often times you will hear stuff used interchangeably.• 4k isn’t all the same. So the term 4k related to the number of pixels on your screen.o 1080p was previous HD (high definition) and was 1920x1080 pixels.o 4k is generally 3840x2160• UHD is ultra high definition which also refers to the resolution of 3840x2160, however there are two versions of this.o One is 30hz. Normal movies and tv look “normal”o 60hz is great for action movies and fast movement such as sports• HDR/HDR10 also has two versions, but in simple terms, HDR is used to describe a certain grouping of picture settings to make your 4k look better. Higher contrast rates(darker black and whiter white). However there are 2 versions of this alsoo 30hz for traditional movies and tvo 60hz is great for those action movies and sports.What happened for me. It was time for a new tv. I already had a Yamaha surround sound receiver that all my consoles, and fire/roku sticks, and blueray players plugged into, and one single cable going to my tv. So the setup of a new tv was going to be fairly painless. Find the tv, buy the tv, remove the old tv and replace it with the new one. I got home, got the new one in place and hooked up with one hdmi connection…and it didn’t do 4k. WTF! So I did some research and realized the roku stick that we use for amazon prime, hulu, and Netflix…wasn’t 4k compatible. So I went online, ordered a Roku Premier. I got it the next day, thanks amazon. Hooked it up, and it worked well…but the remote had to be line of site with the roku box. Unfortunately, my home theater setup made this a huge pain in the butt because the roku was hidden behind the Yamaha surround sound receiver. So, I returned this and ordered the Roku Streaming Stick +. Because these are meant to plug in behind the tv or to a surround sound receiver. This in place, and I ran the setup on the roku stick for display and it would do 4k uhd but only in 30hz. Fearing I had bought the wrong one. I took it upstairs to my lg 40” tv and plugged it in, turned on the tv. And the tv recognized the roku stick and I saw the screen go from normal black screen (kinda dark grey really) to true solid black with the HDR logo flashing on screen. When it showed the roku menu, I ran the same display setup and it clicked green check marks next to 4k uhd 30hz, 4k uhd 60hz, 4k hdr 30hz, and 4k hdr 60hz. And the movies (6 underground on Netflix) was just a freaking work of art. So now I knew that it was not the roku stick. So doing more research I found out that my Yamaha rx-v685 surround sound receiver would accept this beautiful signal and would pass through 4k but that the configuration had to be adjusted to do this. So I dug around in the menu, found the setting and clicked it into 4k. It looked okay on the new screen, but didn’t look amazing. So I went back to the google, and found out that my receiver would pass through only 4k uhd 30hz. So…it would look okay. But wouldn’t be jaw dropping. Did some research and found that I needed to buy the newer version of the receiver the RX-v683BL, that was $400 on ebay for a new in box one. It showed up a week later in a damaged box, but was fine cosmetically and functionally. I installed this new receiver with all the same connections and such. And ran the same roku display test, got it to do 4k uhd 30hz, and 4k uhd 60hz but it wouldn’t do 4k hdr 30 or 60. Annoyed at this point, I started scouring everything I could, and started seeing that folks said they solved this problem with better cables. I figured why not. So I found a set that had great reviews on amazon (info below) and those showed up two days later. I ran one of these from the new Yamaha receiver to the tv. Because the roku stick plugged in directly to a port on the back of the tv. Ran the test and got the 4k uhd’s working but only the 4k hdr 30hz working. I wanted the last step because I wanted the 4k resolution with the hdr picture quality with the 60 hz for high speed smooth movements. Annoyed again, I found that the tv instead of using HDMI port 1, needed to have me use HDMI port 2 or 3. I tried that, same. Then I went into the menu for the tv and found that there was a picture setting under settings>watch tv>external inputs>hdmi signal format>select the port 2 I was plugged into now and change it from standard to enhanced 4:4:4 or 4:2:2 mode. Tried again, the image was looking better but the roku still wouldn’t let me have the 4k hdr 60hz. So I checked the Yamaha receiver and the HDMI mode had to be in mode 1 as well as the roku stick had to be in ports 1-5. I ran the test again…still no luck. A final run at google and someone said there was a buried adjustment within the settings>advanced system settings>HDMI output and it also had to be set to the 4:4:4 or 4:2:2. Ran the settings and success! So when I boil it all down, when hooking something up to a 4k UHD HDR10(60hz) tv you need to have the correct device, the correct settings on the device, the right cable, the right port plugged in for the device, and also have the settings enabled for that device. I know that was long winded, but I figure I’ll use this story in the amazon review and maybe it helps someone sometime.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2020","Richard Ricketts",262

"This is a title","Overall I'm pleased with roku stuff. The streaming quality is good, they do what they're intended to do, mostly. There is definitely a compromise between this and the ultra. It's just a lot more sluggish to operate. But my main point of this review is to make a point. I upgraded our stuff because these held the promise of private listening. A feature that's just crucial to a parent who is tired of watching stuff at minimal volume because someone is sleeping or there's language. Sadly that's the main reason I'm disappointed. Private listening, which allows you to watch on your TV, while using the remote app on your phone to stream audio to your headphones. It's a really awesome thing to have, and generally sounds great. But... It just fails to deliver. It does deliver constant audio cut out. Sometimes you lose every other sentence being said. I have to use subtitles just to keep up and I often still have to hit the replay button. I have used 4 different streaming stick+s in three different houses (and three different network setups), and with different phones and headphones combinations. It's their service, plain and simple. And this doesn't have the controller headphone jack so that's not an option. So if you're just using this on a TV to play stuff and have no interest in listening with headphones, then this is a good product. But if you plan on that being a big part of your usage, look elsewhere.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2021","Rob",262

"HDR workaround","Solution/Work around.I have a ROKU Stick+ on an LG 49UH6030. The LG software 05.30.90 is up to date.This LG TV does not handle Amazon Prime HDR properly. The images are way too dark and no settings tweaking makes them acceptable. The LG TV displays Disney+ and Apple TV HDR content just fine, so the problem is probably with the Prime Video app.This problem is apparent on Prime Video via HDMI as well as on the Prime Video app installed on the LG OS. My specific test video is the Amazon-produced Chi-Raq by Spike Lee. I used a DVD of the same content on my upscaling Sony BD player as a control and the DVD disc displayed properly and far better than the 4K HDR streaming on this TV.ROKU reports that the LG TV HDMI port is 4K, HDR, 60 Hz, HDCP 2.2 via the auto-detect in ROKU/Settings/Display_Type.My solution is to choose the 4K, 60 Hz setting without HDR. Now 4K videos that were detected by the TV as having HDR play properly. The LG TV has HDR-effect display settings for non-HDR items to compensate.This LG-TV/Prime Video HDR issue does not appear to be exclusive to the ROKU Stick+ but ROKU's settings flexibility provided the work around that was needed for this TV.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2020","Kostac",264

"Won't control separate audio system - check TV audio pass through compatibility before you buy!","So I have a 5 year old LG TV and a separate sound system. The TV does not control sound through the optical port out for my sound system (just outputs max line level volume always then set my amplifier to a reasonable level). Currently I have a mini computer, which I can control the sound through my wireless keyboard. Therefore the Roku, while it controls the TV sound is unable to control the output to my sound system. Called tech support and they said my TV is too old, although it's not that old... Don't see why the roku can't just control the sound out from the HDMI like a computer can, maybe it takes too much extra electronics. Also, I can't buy a receiver with IR and control it from the remote either because it's only programmed with TV IR codes for some reason (it specifically says cannot control AVR in setup...), seems like another thing they could have added... Either way it doesn't work so I'll either return it or get a pass through line level volume controller with it's own remote, not ideal but it might work.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2020","Ryan Ogilvie",266

"This didn't work and Roku has not helped","I purchased this item about 18 months ago but didn't take it out of the box until two weeks ago. I encountered problems in set up which, upon investigation, was not a unique event- it wouldn't finish set-up, got caught in a loop, etc. I contacted customer support, admitting the ""old"" nature of the device. It took 3 days for any response. The first response told me to try some things which I did with no success and contacted them again. 2 days later they said it was out of warranty. After a few back-and-forths they offered me a 30% discount on buying 2 devices. That was fine but when I put in the discount codes it would only give me 15% on one device (and the 2nd device could have been bought for the same discounted price directly. We are now 17 days into the process with their last non-automated response telling me the matter is settled. Obviously it is not. Maybe most of the devices are good but customer service is sadly lacking.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2020","JAC",267

"Bad remote, don't buy this","I was really happy with my Roku stick + at first. I'm still happy with the Roku but the remote is quitting on me bit by bit. It worked fine at first but then the Back button (the one by the OK button) stopped working. Now this week the Up button stopped working. I'm wondering if the Next button and the Down one will stop next.I've looked all over their site and the Roku tips and troubleshooting channel and can't find anything that addresses this problems. I changed the batteries. I reseated the batteries multiple times.I tried re-pairing the remote to the TV. I have tried every remedy I could find and not only do none of them work but it's slowly getting worse.I would have rated this quite highly if not for the remote issue. I've ordered one of their HDMI extender cables but somehow I don't have a lot of faith in it working either. I've only had this since July which seems really soon for the remote to stop working right. I wonder if they just expect me to order a new remote every 6 months or so.PS I wrote this but got distracted and never submitted it. The remote suddenly started working the same day the extender arrived. Since it was here, I went ahead and connected the extender anyway, even though the remote was now working again. All went well for a while but today the remote went on semi-strike again.Not only can I not use the up or back buttons near the OK button again but now when I try to operate the remote, it randomly goes to a window asking if I want to add ESPN. (For the record, I definitely do NOT.) I tried rebooting and now it wants me to sign into my internet account, something I can't do because the remote won't move the cursor up or back.For the record, I have a Roku Ultra in the living room and it works great. For that matter, when the remote feels like working, the Stick is great too. The thing is, however, that if you can't count on it to work, the Stick is useless. I'd return the thing if I weren't past the return date. If you want a Roku, pay extra and get the Ultra. Don't waste your money and sanity on this version. Seriously, run away fast and hard from it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2019","Debra Allen",267

"Great Device","It works really well for an older TV that is ‘smart’ in name only, no more waiting forever for apps to load! I haven’t tested the 4K capability as my other 4K TV already has Roku built-in, but all other features of this Roku stick work like a charm. I actually use the Roku app on my phone to control all my TVs so I don’t mix the little remotes mixed up (roku TV remote is exactly the same as the stick+ but has some different app buttons at the bottom - the Netflix and HBO ones). The stick+ is very fast to start once plugged into the USB service port on my TV for power and of course the stick has to be plugged in HDMI to work. Initial setup was a breeze because I already have a roku account. I got this to fix the apps crashing on my old Sony TV that has YouTube and Netflix but is a couple years old so has trouble loading the apps and buffering streams. The stick+ has no problem with any content I throw at it. The voice control function is neat for the remote, but I prefer the app anyway for the easy text input when I’m searching. The remote is also small so it easy to misplace (especially if you have little ones). I only use the Netflix, Prime, Viki, Plex, and YouTube apps, but roku has a large store of apps available for download. I’d say most people with 4K TVs will already have smart features built-in to their set so you might be able to save with the non-plus version. I only got the stick+ because it had a great sale, making it cheaper than the regular stick.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2020","Amazon Customer",268

"Remote Died","Since I work for Amazon, I won a Fire Stick a few years ago. I was very disappointed in the performance, and when it fried, I picked up this Roku stick, and I'm happy I did. The options and menu worked fantastically, the buffering was reduced tremendously, and the interface was fantastic.That was just over a year ago. So a few months ago, the remote continuously drained the batteries to corpses overnight every time we didn't take the batteries out (which we shouldn't have to do . . .). So of course things got worse. Yesterday I was watching something and friends dropped off something for me, so I hit pause, and when I came back several minutes later, realized that the play function was not working, so I went through the several annoying steps to re-pair the remote and once it was, hit rewind, then play. The rewind worked, the play and pause and stop -- literally 1/2 second later -- did not. The show rewound to the beginning.I re-paired it again and even went to the online manual, tried everything, forwarded to the point where my show was initially paused, then the play wouldn't work. It went all the way to the end and to the next episode, so once again I had to unplug the USB power to the device and re-pair. This activity has been happening, worse and worse, for over a week.So I checked the order, it's out of support. I am buying it again and this time getting the danged 3-year extended warranty for less than 5 bucks.Great item, mine died fast, so get it with a warranty.Peace.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2020","The Atheist Hindu",269

"Mostly good but a few irritations; nice compliment to the Fire TV","Overall, this is a very nice streaming system. The setup is pretty easy, although not nearly as quick and easy as the Fire TV since you have to register an account on Roku and give them a credit card (it is not charged unless you buy something).I have it connected to an AV receiver and it's working great in terms of both picture and sound. The stick is slim enough to plug into an HDMI port on the back of the receiver without blocking anything. Wireless speed and connectivity is excellent.What I don't like:1. The four one-click buttons on the remote for Netflix, etc. can't be re-programmed. While the Netflix button is great since I have that service, the other 3 are useless. It would have been great to be able to reprogram them to work with an app of my choice.2. The power and volume controls do NOT work with an AV receiver, only a TV. Since I have the stick plugged into my receiver, neither button is functional. Disappointing.I also have a Fire TV box attached to the system. In comparison, the Roku menus are pretty dated looking as is the overall navigation. The remote is more clunky and doesn't respond as quickly at times. But, the Roku has apps that the Fire TV does not, so having both gives me more choices.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2018","Comdet",270
"Works great when it works. The remote was faulty and Roku Customer Service is horrible","I've previously purchased and installed about 7 of these streaming stick +s, all without a problem. I purchased this one in January for my home, and the remote didn't work out of the box. I did all the troubleshooting, replaced batteries with new (which it drained in one day), searched Roku community boards, and it was clear this is a faulty remote. (I used the iPhone Roku app to control the stick and that worked perfectly, so we know it was the remote itself.) I reported all of this on the community boards with no reply from Roku. I tried customer service. No phone number was available to call, and email correspondence was broken, so I used the chat feature. I spent about 40 minutes on the chat explaining all the troubleshooting I did, providing serial and model numbers, etc, etc. I just asked for them to replace the remote, not the entire device. Well, as of today, they have yet to respond with any resolution (the device was purchased in early January, it's a month later as of this writing). By the way, did I mention that according to the Roku community, this is a known issue?I returned the entire device to Amazon, after speaking to Amazon customer service, and they supported that return. I purchased a new one (for $10 less!) but when it arrived, the box had already been torn open, so given my recent experience, I returned it to Amazon the same day.I know everything is crazy regarding the pandemic, but this was a simple issue they could have easily resolved and kept a happy customer. I may purchase an Apple TV instead (yes, it's more expensive, but I have an older one and it works great--and Apple customer service is excellent) Not sure what I'm going to do with the others, but if they begin to have issues, they may be going back as well. Sorry Roku, I was your biggest fan before this recent experience. Please fix your customer service.When they work, they're great. Good luck if they don't.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2021","A. Monfalcone",270

"Intermittent function issues combined with wretched ""customer service""","For this item, and for my other Roku (a Roku Express), I have been plagued with technical issues, and with some of the slowest, least-helpful ""customer service"" I can remember having with any product/service that I have purchased in recent years. A specific current example: For 11 days running, I have been unable to access any of the movie/TV titles that I follow, which I am supposed to see under the function ""My Feed"", with updates about the availability of any of the titles I follow, sometimes daily. Now, I am unable to see any of them, and, when I began emailing them about this problem, I only got the initial automated response that they received my complaint, but, for the next 8 days, no one would even give me the courtesy of a response, and, when someone finally did after 8 days, it was only to say that they are ""working on it"".

Haven't had any issues at all and it has all the same apps I had on Firestick and more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2021","Corey J.",271

"Poor wifi range that definitely was not as advertised.","I purchased this unit solely on the promise of long range wifi. I have been using a 4k Firestick which has a less than stellar wifi range. I have the 2 hooked up side by side in hdmi 2 and 3. There is absolutely no difference in wifi connectivity range between the two. Tech support from Amazon and Roku are handled by folks in the Philippines. While they are all very polite and try hard, they are very little help do to language barriers and the fact that they don't actually know much of what they're talking about. They simply lookup questions on the computer and give canned answers. They don't know enough about the product they're supporting to actually think logically about their answers. That is just such an incredible disservice to their customers. After using the Firestick for several months I found using the Roku kind of clunky. The Firestick reacts more quickly when you make channel selections and switching wifi networks like I need to do from time to time takes fewer commands with the Firestick. When using the Roku and watching multiple episodes of a series, it will sometimes freeze right when the new episode is about to play. I then am forced to press the home button and go back into it again. This never happens with the Firestick. Maybe the Roku is just defective but Tech Support being as described was no help in determining this. If the wifi range was as good as advertised then I could deal with the other issues but since it isn't in this case, I'll be returning the unit. At least Amazon makes that part very easy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2019","Scott",271

"Don't waste your money.","I've been a Roku customer from the beginning. I decided to upgrade mine to this model. 2 weeks into owning and I started having issues with the audio and the picture. Sometimes the picture will go out and I still have sound sometimes the sound will go out and I still have a picture. In order to fix this you have to turn the unit off and then turn it back on. I changed slots I changed devices still the same issues. So I had Amazon send me a new one. Now I'm having the same issues with this one and a new error has popped up which is overheating I've only had it a couple of weeks. I'm sending this one back as well. After researching the internet it appears that I'm not the only one experiencing these issues. To stop the overheating issue they will send you a free stick extender. It appears roku's quality has been going downhill or I've just purchased from a bad lot either way I'm done with Roku.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2021","Di",272

The remote is cheaply made and stopped voice recognition after 5 months of usage and stopped working completely in less than an year. I called the Roku customer service to resolve about the remote issue and since i passed the 1 year warranty, they said they cant help me with it and asked me to buy a new remote for which i will have to shell another $30 ? If the Roku device is reset and God forbid the remote stopped working the whole unit becomes useless, as in my case.I would never trust another Roku device and will never buy one either when they can't even get their remote work properly, which malfunction within a year !","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2019","MM",273

"Save yourself the cash, and get the Roku express or other cheaper option","Update 01/14: HDMI Extension cable showed up, once plugged into the correct port on the TV everything seems to working fine thus far. The instructions Roku provides does state something about making sure your HDMI port is 2.0 or something like that so the frustration was more my POS Vizio ""4k"" Smart TV and not so much the Roku. Just wished I would've seen a review of someone having a similar problem or the seller mentioning this as possibly being a problem on the product page. Either way it works now.I haven't even gotten much past the setup of this stick as for some reason it is throwing an HDCP error on the TV. I assume it something between the Vizio smart TV and this stick not talking to each other correctly through the HDMI port I plugged it into (Odd as I can plug anything else in that port and it works). Unfortunately given the length of this stick I am not able to plug it into any other HDMI port except the side, so in order to try and use a different port I had to shell out an additional $10 for an HDMI extension cable. That cable has not shown up yet, but if it does not work by switching ports I am returning this. The voice remote will also not work with the Vizio TV and the only ""support"" Roku gives you through the error link is how to repair the remote to the Roku itself. Funny cause I got this model specifically to use for Volume and power on the TV also and that doesn't even work. Hoping that has to do with the HDCP error as well but we will see. All in all thus far I am highly disappointed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2021","TM1NE",273

Customer service has been ZERO help suggesting that I “try to use it on a different TV” as if I had a spare TV lying around my living room. This is a brand new LG OLED TV, so it’s not like I’m using a TV that’s a decade old. How about you, Roku, work on fixing your product rather than blaming it on someone else’s!

"1 yr Review Update: Constant wifi drops, display problems and technical issues abound. Do not buy.","1 year review update:Boy was I wrong about Roku being a solution. After a year now I can say with certainty that rokus own technology - hardware and especially software - are the very things youll be fighting with daily. This is horrible tech and theres no solutions here, just more problems than youve already got.Frequently dropping wifi, constant HDCP issues and settings that keep ""forgetting"" themselves, crashes all the time and all manner of streaming issues. Sometimes the picture is so pixelated I cant make it out, like it's a dying VCR tape or something - and Ive got 60M meg downstream cable internet service. Roku is the only platform that makes netlfix, hulu and sometimes Youtube an absolute chore to watch in comfort.My roku 4k plus Roku Streaming stick is garbage and a waste of time. I want to burn it, like in a fire. Thats how unhappy I am with Roku.Old review:Roku does a good job, and it kinda the Peacemaker of streaming platforms. Ok, yes the User Interface sucks and is pretty non-uniform/inconsistent in design, but the technology is GREAT and most importantly Roku is the only neutral ground for TV cable-cutter streaming services. Playstation has Vue so theyll never allow DirectTV Now or Sling or YouTube TV apps on PS4/PS5 etc, Amazon has their streaming services so they also ban certain direct competitors apps, same with Google TV devices and Apple TV etc...Most hardware manufacturers also have their own competing streaming services or have exclusive deals with one of them, and so they actively prevent and ban any competition from their platform, forcing the customer to use the one available option. Roku is like Switzerland - independent and neutral, without a directly competing service... And so EVERYONE makes a Roku app, and in that sense Roku is a fair free-trade zone, where quality and value of a given service is the only way to beat a competiting app... Roku is a neutral space where all the dirty tricks various companies use to force you to exist solely within their own software ecosystem don't have any reach. A pure free market, allowing the customer to win no matter how cutthroat the varied service providers want to be. Roku is the sherrif that keep Corporate greed at bay in a way. Worth dealing with the frustratingly poor UI design.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2018","Sunny",274

"How To Fix Issues with 4k HDR Samsung TVs","We've loved Roku for a long time. This year we decided to upgrade our TV to a 4k HDR Samsung. To provide the streaming services, we got this Roku Streaming Stick +. Unfortunately, the picture quality through the Roku was terrible - washed out colors, contrast too high, everything too dark, and lost clarity. This was universal, but especially bad in some Disney Plus titles like the Mandalorian, which was unwatchable.I still had the old LED TV with a Roku 3, and I compared them side by side. The old setup looked perfect. So I plugged in my Roku 3 to the new TV - and the issues all disappeared. It was crisp, bright, and colorful. So the issues were with the new Roku Streaming Stick+.To make a long story short, after much experimentation and research, I was able to get the new Roku to look as good as the old. Here's how you do it:• Go to Settings > Display type and set it to just 4k - WITHOUT the HDR. It turns out that there are some issues with Samsung TV's HDR settings and 4k Rokus. Upon changing this setting, I found my picture through the new Roku Streaming Stick+ was once again clear and bright.• The other issue was all the ""smart"" features on the Samsung were messing things up. Turning them all off and setting the TV to ""Game mode: On"" for the Roku brought back the intended brightness, contrast, and color range.As an aside, when these issues appeared, I also bought a Chromecast with Google TV. It had the same issues as the new Roku, but did NOT have the ability to turn off HDR, so it wasn't able to solve all the display issues like the Roku.I hope this helps someone!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2020","Shambalagala",275

"Upgrade your ""dumb"" TV already!","TLDR: worth it, buy it.Over the years of the streaming revolution, Roku decided to toss their hat into the ring. They were absolutely garbage. Delayed remote input, latency issues on wifi, and limited streaming options were just some of the reasons I despised Roku, ESPECIALLY the sticks.It's been YEARS since I've given them a chance though. My son received a Roku TV from his grandmother. She got my wife and I a Roku TV and she upgraded her own TV with this exact Roku stick.I was blown away by how well it works. There's plenty of features but the two I enjoy most are the voice control though the App and being able to toggle between Roku devices on the same network. These features didnt really exist back in the day so I was utterly amazed by them. Not only were they available, but they work VERY well.For streaming options, you've got just about anything you'd want. I've got my cable on there, Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, YouTube, Minno, and BabyFirstTV. It's serves me well for doing just about everything I could want out of a streaming stick.It ALSO has screen mirroring capabilities! Not really an option people seem to use a lot, but definitely worth mentioning. I used to swear by chromecast devices for streaming and screen mirroring, but since being turned onto Roku (again) I was more than eager to get this stick!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2020","Tim",276

"Love and hate relationship","This was not easy to set up. Ultimately I did not ditch my cable service like I thought I was going to. But I did downgrade it which saved me some money. We have multiple TV’s in the household, and it is to much of a drain on the internet to be watching at once. It was constantly buffering and it was annoying.Setting up: It took me almost 6 hours. It kept giving me error codes. I had to reach out to support multiple times to get it to work (also if you have to call support they charge you money). Thankfully I was able to sort this one out looking at their common problems. It was just frustrating.They don’t have long enough cords to plug into the wall. My second TV I still haven’t set up because I haven’t purchased extensions to use the Roku. They need to come with longer cords. My gaming devices has longer cords than this. Come on Roku.The voice recognition only works maybe 50% of the time. It is more frustrating than Siri. But when it does work I love this feature, it is something every cable/satellite service should have.I love all the TV channels and most of them are free. It is great. I down graded my TV package to the lowest level but I don’t feel I am missing out. There is so much to choose from. The application is basic, but I don’t mind if it has the channels I like. I love that it even has YouTube. Something Amazon fire doesn’t have.UPDATE: The life of the product doesn’t look hopeful. In less than two weeks my Roku has died. I am sending I back to Amazon for a refund. I am wondering if I should do the same with the other as well. For a $60 product you expect it to last. I’m hoping it was a fluke but this has me worried.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2019","Elisabeth Berlowitz",279

"Should be your go to streaming device.","I've had previous generations of Roku products. I've had AppleTVs. I have a FireTV stick. My TV has crappy online streaming features. After trying pretty much all the options for streaming TV I keep coming back to Roku products. They're reasonably priced and are almost constantly on sale. They're platform agnostic and support any subscription service you can throw at it. Setup is easy and consistent. I rarely have had a Roku product software crash or misperform. I don't yet have a 4K TV nor do I use the voice search function much, but I still got this model just to future proof myself. I tend to use the physical remote instead of the phone remote, but the mobile app works in an emergency and is intuitive and available for iOS and Android.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2018","BS AZ",280

"Good wifi reception, remote keeps losing connection","I've tried various iterations of Rokus, fire sticks, and older Apple TVs, and this is my favorite device so far. The biggest advantage for me is wifi range. I use an extender to reach a detached garage and shed, and other devices, including other Roku models, work only some of the time. This one has been solid though. The Roku interface is easy to use, and loading and response times are pretty decent with this, especially compared to some Roku tvs I have that are less than 2 years old. The one downside, which is annoying enough that it's almost a dealbreaker, is that the remote constantly loses connection. I use this with USB power on a garage TV that only gets turned on every couple weeks, which might have something to do with it, but the remote will power the Roku (and TV) on and get me to the home screen, but then stops responding. I have to open the battery compartment and hit the little pair button almost every time. Then it works fine, but it's pretty annoying.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2021","Jay",281

"Beyond disgusted.","For some reason my Roku Stick+ has stopped working. I unplugged it to have the room painted and plugged it back in and now it won’t connect to the internet. I unplugged it a month before when I moved and didn’t have this problem.So I read the blog, followed all steps. No help. I reached out to Roku support and we go back and forth. I have to send them the router info, my wifi speed, etc. I use the Roku remote, Roku app or RoByte to control the Roku Stick+. Whichever is closet at the moment. Nothing works. They decide the remote is faulty and send me another remoteGuess what, same issue - won’t pair. Since I bought this product in May 2021, by now you would think they would arrange a replacement. NOPE.

"Better than some things, but the ad buttons irritate me","I got this because even though my TV has built-in Netflix and some other things, it doesn't have YouTube or Funimation, so I had been using the PS4 apps for those, and they're not good. The Roku version of the Funimation app is much better. If you only need the biggest streaming services (Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc.) then most TVs seem to come with those already these days. But Roku is pretty good for smaller channels.My main gripe is the fact that they sell positions on the quick buttons to various companies/channels, and you as the consumer have zero control over which buttons you get. Mine came with Disney Plus, Netflix, Sling, and Hulu. If you don't actually use the apps on the buttons, those buttons are just wasted and annoying. You can't even see which buttons any individual remote will have when you buy it (they rotate, but it's pure chance what you'll get). I just really hate buying a product and then having part of *my* possession sold as ad space for a company I may or may not want to support or have any interest in. Roku offers a version that has programmable buttons--but it's the most expensive version, it's only two buttons, and those are *in addition to* the four buttons that they sell as ad space. I wish Roku would focus more on their customers than their vendors/business partners and instead put the ad buttons only on the very cheapest model or as a cheaper version of each model (so you get a discount for agreeing to see the ads) and just make all four buttons programmable by the user as the default.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2020","Ssssss",282
"A cheaper, equally clever alternative to Apple TV. Its flaws are less severe than Apple TV's.","1) The streaming seems flawless on this device - and on the ""ultra"", which I purchased first.2) There is a dizzying number of channels, and except for the movies at the apple store, you essentially get all the channels found on apple.3) Subscription for YouTube TV is $50 when you use the YouTube TV app in Roku. I'm told it is $55.00 if you subscribe to YouTube TV on Apple TV; you pay Apple $60.00 extra bucks per year - the price of a good Roku device.4) However, some areas are significantly less developed than others. It has excellent connectivity, and streaming, programming are great. But even though it’s been around for many years, it has some frustrating interface problems.a) You cannot setup any of the device parameter from your computer. On the other hand, Apps and individual channels allow you to setup setup online, and the settings are preserved from one Roku device to the other. An example is YouTube TV and PBS.b) On your computer, you can select Roku channels/apps and your work will apply to to all the devices. But you cannot setup any particular sequencing for the icons. You can sequence them on a device, but Roku doesn't let you share that sequencing on other devices. For example, if you want YouTube TV at the top, followed by Netflix, you must separately rearrange the icons on each device.c) The buttons on the remote are not programmable. If you don't want a subscription to Netflix, why should a button devoted to Netflix be in your face all the time? why should you be subjected to the risk of pressing the button in the dark? Roku's solution to accidental button presses is to ask: ""are you sure you want to exit whatever you're watching?"" - but this addresses a totally different problem. THERE SHOULD BE A WAY TO DEFEAT THESE BUTTONS OR TO PROGRAM THEM AS YOU WISH. Netflix pays money to Roku for this, but Roku subjects the customers to frustration, as they are likely to press the button my mistake and then have to go through several steps in order to get out of, for example, Netflix.Still and all, I think Roku is every bit as good as Apple TV. Roku's most expensive device, during discounts times, is less than half the price of Apple TV.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2019","bleuler",282

"So disappointed. I have the static/snow bug.","So disappointed. I have the static/snow bug. Hooked up the new stick today and every five minutes the screen goes to snow, you can still hear sound and it will stay that way for a little while and then the picture will come back. If you unplug the HDMI and plug it back in it will bring back the picture. To troubleshoot I plugged in my old Roku 3 and it has been playing for two hours now on YouTube TV without any issues, changed nothing except for the devices. Update: Roku did respond to me on Twitter. The problem for me appears to be that the new devices do not work through either an HDMI splitter or my particular Samsung receiver. Plugged directly into my TVs they work. In the room where I have a projector I have multiple devices and I need a splitter so I will use the older Roku three. Kind of lousy that the $35 fire stick works with the splitter and receiver no problem but not the Roku streaming stick plus with newer and supposedly more advanced technology-but at least I got everything working. They seem to work pretty well now that I can actually use them, but big negative that I have to use older tech with my projector because of the snow bug.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2018","Mikea64",282

"If only the remote worked as well as the stick","The best thing about this is the format. The USB stick shaped device is one , more device not cluttering up the TV area or unhidden wire running to the electrical socket. The worst thing about this device is the remote. It doesn't always work in a timely manner. You point it at the device, push a button and nothing happens for 15 - 60+ seconds (not an exaggeration for me). I've had instances where I have found my phone, pulled up the Roku app there, and made the same selection ... And then had the original function finally work leading to unnecessary interruptions. It's the worst! I've actually considered going back to my old Roku box because the remote always works. The only reason I don't is because I can't get some apps to work on my older box due to the software. What should also be mentioned is for some reason, Roku doesn't supply you with a connector you may need for charging the stick through USB. The connector is free, but you have to request it first. It should already be in the box. They even cover the shipping. Makes no sense and not good customer service because it was either use an extension cord (which I don't have) to plug it in (the original cord was to short for the height of my wall-mounted) or wait.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2019","KFlowers",282

"I love Roku, but the remote will NOT stay paired!","I ordered my first Roku in 2012. It was an LT. it has been great! When we upgraded to a 4K tv, I wanted to get a 4K streaming device, so I ordered this. The picture is really awesome and we have not had buffering issues, like we had started having with our LT. It was nice at first to not have to point the remote at an IR device. Despite all the channels and niceties of the device, two things were annoying. Only one of this things so bad that it absolutely won’t work for us. First, the addition of amazon ads was a surprise and a TRULY annoying one, as now we need to have our children cover eyes and mute the tv during ads. Typically they are ok, but we have a particularly visually sensitive child and he can’t handle some of them.The thing that made us have to return this twice and downgrade to the Roku Express is the fact that the remote will NOT stay paired. It goes great for initial setup but loses the remote soon thereafter. It says there is a paired remote, but it does not work. This happened the first time and we thought it was a fluke so we returned it. The second one did the same. At this point I don’t want anything that pairs with a remote via WiFi. So, I looked at the ones that I am assuming are infrared and it just seemed silly to pay for the premiere so we are going to try the express. It doesn’t have 4K so I am very frustrated, but there is no way I am buying the Ultra. If the express doesn’t work I am not sure what I will do. I have read similar negative reviews where the remote would not stay paired so I am not the only one with this issue.

After painfully typing in my long Netflix password using the dpad it then proudly displayed a HDCP refusing to work. I'd like to point out the ChromeCast enforces DRM and HDCP checks too and had no problem. If you are doing ANYTHING more than plugging this Roku directly into a TV don't bother. It's not worth the HDCP headache. Literally refused to work with anything despite validating my setup during install. If they refuse to accept HDCP 1.4 connections it'd be nice to know that before requiring me to setup an account and requiring me to setup a method of payment on the account to even finish creating the account.

"Exellent upgrade for 4K","An excellent upgrade to Roku streaming devices. I've used Roku streaming devices for years and I've never had one fail. This streamer provides true 4K output and slightly improves wireless signal reception in areas where your wireless router signal may not be full strength. Roku's remotes get slightly better with each generation and this one is no exception. Buttons are crisper and presets for various streaming services work well.Roku's User Interface (UI) has evolved. It works well but as I test it against Apple TV's latest version and Amazon's latest UI I find Apple's UI to now be the most useful. Roku in my view still beats Amazon's latest convoluted UI. Roku should look at Apple TV's UI for the future. Unfortunately, Apple has failed to produce a streaming stick and Roku fills this void nicely.I like Roku devices because they work well all the time. They are like the Toyota of streaming devices. They compete well pricewise.

Once we got that we could easily plug it into our tv and all our problems were solved.The total per to this model is it can easily travel. You can unplug it and plug it into your hotel tv. What fun was that. At night when we got back to our hotel we were able to unwind just like we do at home.

We have had a lot of streaming devices in the past, and none of them have exhibited this behavior. Ironically, the Stick+ is the closest to the router. Of the 6 streaming devices that are connected in the house now, 2 are Roku Premieres, and they work perfectly. I'll never purchase a Roku ""stick"" type device in the future, so I hope that they don't move to all ""stick"" devices. We'll probably replace it with a 3rd Roku Premiere, as they work very well.

"Couldn't be happier!!! Cord-cutters, this is it!","Arrived on time in solid packaging. Very, very pleased with my purchase. I cut the cord years ago but I've been steadily looking for a platform that met all my needs and wants, that didn't cost an arm and a leg, and didn't take a NASA engineer to hook up. I got EVERYTHING and MORE! I was THRILLED to only make a one-time purchase and have no monthly fee. This mini-computer hooks up to the back of your tv in a snap, and if you can use a cell phone, you can program it. Very clean, simple user interface; thorough, but concise, directions. Once I got it hooked up, I was astounded by all the choices. I don't watch much regular TV at all, but I can get a reel of my local and regional newscasts, the big three US networks stream 24/7, and the choices of tv show/movie programming is mind-boggling. You can use Prime or any of the other major streaming channels, they have TONS of free programming, and you can order any movie ever produced, basically. You can get music channels, watch YouTube, and I'm sure I'll discover more. I upgraded and got the voice remote. This has everything Xfinity has and way more than Spectrum, with no stupid $85/mth for basic cable. Oh, if you're a FoxNews fan or any channel that only comes with a cable subscription, you do have to sign in with that. But I don't watch any 24/7 news so that wasn't an issue for me. If you're looking to cut the cord and still get value out of your programming choices, buy this. I consider this one of the most valuable, cost-effective purchases I've made in recent memory. 100% satisfied.

Streaming quality is awesome and I love the fact that this little widget gets plugged into the back of the tv instead of taking up precious real estate on my table. The biggest bonus is that the remote now controls my tv, but that’s where I’m having a problem. The up volume button on my Roku remote is somehow changing the source on the tv and, since I no longer have the tv remote, I have to get up, cross the room and manually put the tube back on HDMI1 (woe is me). I docked my review one star for this because it’s heckin’ annoying and happens a lot. Otherwise, I’m a happy couch potato. Bring on the binges!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2021","Georgie Lowery",286

"Would NOT Recommend","Around 2019, I had gotten one of the other Roku streaming devices. It was like a small square receiver, not sure of the exact product name as I had thrown away the box. It stopped working after not even a year of use. I didn't complain, just sucked it up and used the features on my smart TV instead (I got the Roku because the TV is old and slow and it's app store is outdated). Well around Black Friday of 2021, I figured I'd buy this product as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend because it was on sale... I wish I didn't. It is really not even worth the sale price. The sound cuts in and out while watching anything, and I have even double checked that it was plugged in all the way several times and that is not the problem. It also has such a bad battery life. The screen constantly says that it needs to charge, even though it is plugged in at all times. I've been disappointed in Roku products twice now, so I wouldn't recommend them to anyone I know. I am going to try to contact the company to see if they can resolve or replace the product.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2022","Bridgette Romanov",286

"Just buy an Xbox One S or X honestly.","I recently purchased this product to compare with my Xbox one X. I wanted something that could work with the apps that I have and for family so they dont need to use my xbox.But my issues are this. The roku’s surround sound options doesnt compute completely with my set up. Yesterday I logged into my accounts, and I tried playing movies that I owned. Surround worked on what I purchased, yet there was audio lag and my subwoofer would make noises when someone spoke. On apps that I didnt personally buy, surround sound was non existent. And if it did, it was totally random and loud af. I kept messing around with the settings hoping I could find the right one but due to the rokus limitations. I just stopped looking because for some reason the movies I have were playing in Dolby Digital DTS and the regular apps only played in Stereo regardless of what setting I put in. Another issue is you also gotta understand that I have 4K HDMI splitter, so I couldnt have the option to just turn off the roku. It would turn off everything. And even so, when I would turn off the tv and sound system, the roku would still be playing. I took alot of my time trying to figure out the simplicity of this product only to just fall on my face with disappointment. And to remind you all, my Xbox set up took my sound system perfectly. I didnt have to change my subwoofer setting, the ONLY thing that roku has alil bit better is the screen quality in certain movies. But it doesnt mean a damn thing if the sound isnt fully there to accommodate that. I spent about 6+ hrs trying to research or work on the settings or cross checking between the roku and xbox.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2020","J.Cole",287

"Good but poor design due to weight and delicate connections","This was a good buy and I love the Roku set-up (except for the quick buttons to Hulu which I always accidentally tap and which take me to those streaming channels instead of the one I'm on). HOWEVER, within a couple months in, I realized how poor the design is and that it quickly weakens and in the end, breaks the connection. The weight of the connecting cables pulled apart the coupling from the Roku stick to the next wiring. At first, I was able to gerry-rig it to stay put with tape on the back of the TV, but it the whole thing was finally dismantled last night. An electrician (which I'm not) might be able to fix it. Just be aware that the roku devices that sit on a surface will probably have more long-term use. This was my first stick and last.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2022","LuvBritTV",287
"It’s OK, but it ain’t cable","Roku is OK for people that are low on funds or don’t have a cable connection nearby. But sorry, my cable subscription kicks the tar out of this thing. If you enjoy having to login every couple days by going to the stations website, locating your Internet provider and entering a password. Knock yourself out. It’s tedious and annoying. Additionally, if you enjoy watching multiple shows in a brief period of time (a flipper), this device is not for you. I could flip through a dozen favorite channels with my cable remote in the same amount of time I can log out of one Roku station and login to another. So while I’m glad I have a couple Roku’s on TVs in my house, it won’t be replacing my cable subscription anytime soon. It’s simply not nearly as capable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2022","JWAGCT",287

"You still have to pay for basic everyday movies/TV shows","Looking for a cord cutting service that's like my cable service. Just want a ""live tv guide"" with movies integrated for free. With the choice of my paying for newer movies . not older movies.People always say you can watch movies / tv. But they don't say that movies/ tv shows are limited , Basic and old. You have to pay for 99c to 3.00 plus to watch a movie or episode.It's actually just a thumb drive with downloaded files consisting of applications similar to ( hulu-netflix- crackle) offering ""basic movies and TV"" shows older than what's on your actual cable to paying for intermediate to more recent content. I'm disappointed.Ex. Men in black (1) can watch on cableFree. With Roku-firestick. Etc. They request 99 to 2.99 to just watch. Rent at a higher price.I think ""kodi"" is the best device. Not always stable but stable enough. You can see everything movies just leaving theater, all seasons TV shows and don't have to pay. You just have to be a little tech savvy to do the same things in Roku and fire sticks downloading the apps like hulu, crackle, to get their movies /TV shows, News networks to see their content.But with Kodi all contents is free. The sites databases ""mdb"" the content come from can choose. But you just go to another.With these sticks- they are usually always working because you pay to watch that 1 episode TV show or movie and they will keep it stable for you.With Kodi the developers work to build this app to keep mdb open /stable for you to watch content free. I'm still looking at it Roku. But I may be going back to Kodi.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2020","tanya",288

I had to upgrade so I chose this model and like that the actual box is now integrated and hidden , plus it is works well even if router may not be in same room. The only thing I am not sure with is it doesn't always pick up remote actions even if remote is pointed directly at TV in various directions. This is disappointing and it could be a factor for returning it. The voice recognition is adequate.We are not always looking at TV in LR so to have this happen when we do is a little irritating. I still have the window to return and because of the above might do so.

"A great way to access entertainment beyond cable","Roku is simply the best system on the market. FireTV and AppleTV are fine and solid performers, but Roku's open system still provides access to the widest range of programming outside of the wire based cable world. The setup process was easy enough that my six year old grandson had the system up and running in ten minutes. Voice commands work well and the range is greater than anything I will ever be able to take advantage of in my home. I can stream 4K programming without any skipping or lag (keep in mind that this is dependent upon your own wireless network speed). So, you have a low cost way to expand your entertainment network by literally thousands of options. What's not to like? The only problem you will encounter is figuring out what to watch next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2020","Campmaster55",288
"Solution for “HDCP Error”.","I purchased the Roku Streaming Stick + a few months back but have been having persistent HDCP Errors. The Error would happen every few minutes and was extremely annoying. I really wanted this $56 device to work so I researched several solutions and found this one on some geek page. I don’t know what that says about me but, long story short here’s what you can do if returning your Roku Streaming Stick + is no longer an option and you have an extra $40 to spend.In able to use a HDMI cable that is HDCP 2.2 compliant as the Error page indicates, you must first plug your ROKU SS+ into the input of a HDCP 2.2 compliant HDMI splitter, then connect your 2.2 compliant cable to one of the outputs on the splitter to a HDMI input on your TV. Since the Roku SS+ derives it’s power through a very short usb cable, I simply kept the splitter/Stick union close to the USB port on the back of the TV to allow use of the provided cable front the Roku SS+ to the usb port. I happened to already have a 3D brand splitter that worked just fine but I suspect others will work as well as long as they are HDCP 2.2 compliant.I’ve included some pics. Note you can see both ends of my new, black colored HDMI cable running from the splitter output to the HDMI input on the TV (the HDMI input on my tv is sort of hidden behind the Roku in the picture) and the short usb cable running from the Roku SS+ to the USB port on my LG tv for power. The splitter has a stand alone power source but when I plugged the USB powered Roku into the splitter it provided power to both the splitter and the Roku and I did not need to use it. Hope this helps!Two days since I added the splitter to my cable arrangement and so far no more HDCP Errors! The picture and sound is fantastic. Finally working like it should have on its own. Would have gotten 5 stars if it had!","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2018","TBird",288

"Can be frustrating, but overall 4 stars.","So at first I did get the purple screen saying error, but after about a half hour of troubleshooting, I figured out I just needed to use a different hdmi port. It was very frustrating, but my new Sony 4k hdr TV will only work with this roku in the 2nd hdmi port. (I thought it would be the first, who knew...) Then I had experienced how some people are saying their remotes just stop working. This had happened and it was an overall easy fix. It just needed to be paired with my roku once again. Also frustrating, but it's working again. Due to these two issues I would give it 3 stars, but when I finally got everything working, the quality is amazing! And the roku stick works very well. This was my first experience with Roku. Definitely make sure you have a 4k HDR ultra HD tv when buying this, otherwise I think you should stick with the cheaper one. So overall, I say 4 stars because the quality is so good, but i think the start up guide could be a little better with detailed instructions and trouble shooting for the remote and start up.

Speaking of Amazon, when I contacted them about this issue, they provided outstanding customer service, as usual. My experience with Amazon was the opposite of that with Roku.

The ROKU remote itself also has an option for voice activation and you are able to press a button and talk to the Roku device (i.e., open Netflix).Roku has a streaming option, I have connected my Grandparent's iPhones and my Android to this device. I can share my screen onto the TV. I can share phones, connect the Youtube from my phone and share it onto the ROKU and watch it on the TV.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2022","Amazon Customer",292

"Great for Plex, has lots of apps for almost everything immaginiable for streaming services.","I mostly use this for my Plex media server and amazon prime streaming, and it works so much better than my PS4, which would buffer or suffer quality loss somehow? from Plex I think Roku has better codec support maybe? Not a detailed video person encoding, transcoding, bits, bitrates, YBCBAC, or whatever, all pretty confusing, but Roku makes streaming fast and easy, although one thing I will say is not sure if it's my TV or the Roku will sometimes hang on amazon prime and give a playback error when watching HDR shows, doesn't happen a lot, only a handful of times in the almost year I've had it.Con:Batteries die fast, less fast than older model, I assume the wireless buttons use a lot more power, because when they stop functioning usually the IR blaster will still function for things like volume up/down on tv.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2021","Michael M.",292

"Good when it worked properly","The wifi connected remote NEVER worked properly from day 1.I ordered the longer dongle, which made ZERO difference - and also a new remote; same story.I found an odd work-around out of frustration, by simply pushing on the remote buttons repeatedly until the remote finally connected with the device, and that lasted for a year.Now, almost a year to the date of purchase, NEITHER of my two remotes will connect, and neither will my iphone using the ROKU app.My tech level knowledge I'd rate at 7 out of ten, and I know how to manipulate my wireless router to allow for different masking and sub-categories relevant to setup of this device. All attempts have failed, and I am positively TIRED of looking for workarounds.I will attempt to get ROKU to rectify this situation. Like I said, this is a good unit WHEN it works.I do like the wireless remote, but it is THE weak point of this system.As info I have an older basic Roku unit that is nearly 8 years old, and it still works flawlessly in a separate room, on an older tv. Makes me wonder if I should have purchased another one of THOSE instead of the Streaming Stick Plus??I like the speed of this unit, and the menus are intuitive and functional - better than the onboard android OS on my Sony Bravia TV.I do on occasion, also experience the Dual-Screen ""green-out"" anomaly that others have reported as well. But that is an easy fix with a simple restart.I dont think I'd buy THIS particular unit again - but I do like ROKU.Support online has been mediocre to this point, and it took jumping through some hoops and a few nasty emails to get them to send me a new dongle and remote at the beginning of this year long journey.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2020","Harry Hedonist",292

"Best of the Best!","I tried Amazon Fire's new model, and several others. This is the one to buy! Super easy setup. Best of the Best as far as the user interface goes. Adding new apps/channels is a breeze and they support nearly everything, including my DS Video from Synology for accessing my NAS. Also, if you have a USB port on your TV, then you don't need a power adapter at all, just plug it into the HDMI for your video input and Pigtail the included USB cable into the USB port on your TV and i that will power the device. Very feature rich and in my opinion, the best streaming device on the market. Roku has come a LONG way since they started.

"Factory resets itself every couple of days....","We have Roku sticks on our office TV at work and have NEVER experienced any problems with reception or unexpected ""reboots"". This one literally *reboots* every couple of days, requiring us to re-enter all our logins and passwords for all our apps... which is SUPER ANNOYING to ""type"" in with the remote control.When it needs to buffer it will just freeze completely and you have to turn the whole TV off and start all over from the home screen. After the first few days,, it stopped synching with the TV and no longer controls power and volume, which it did in the beginning. Unsure if we somehow ended up with a bootleg/counterfeit item, or if it just has some software or hardware issues... but THIS particular item/seller - would NOT recommend!!!

"I'm happy","I bought the Roku Streaming Stick+ for two reasons. I wanted to be able to watch more than DVDs in the RV and I wanted to add smart TV features to the older flat screen in our bedroom. The Streaming Stick+ works well in our bedroom. It was on sale for $10 off, so I figured it was worth a try.It only took me 10 of 15 minutes to get it up and running. I connected it to our WiFi, set up Amazon Prime and added a few free channels. The next day I connected it to a couple more channels using my Dish Network login at no addition cost. It's perfect for our bedroom. If I only use this in our bedroom, I will be happy with our purchase.The HDMI port on the TV in the RV, was orientated straight out the back, and there is not enough room between the back of the TV and the wall. I ordered some very short HDMI extension cables. I haven't had a chance to use it in the RV, but as long as I can connect to a wifi or the hotspot on my phone with unlimited data I should be fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2021","Amazon Customer",294

"Stopped working after 6 months, then reset and fixed","Product worked fine, until mid-movie the other day. I have 3 Rokus, all purchased at different times. This latest one I purchased in February 2020. It lasted until August. I swapped with older Rokus on other TVs to confirm that it was this one, and not the internet connection, that was bad. I'm disappointed that the 6-month Roku support ended about 2 weeks before this issue. I would like to Roku support before buying another unit.Follow up: I could not easily navigate to follow up via Amazon on this. However, I did follow up with Roku. They said that I should do a factory reset, then send in for a replacement. I did the factory reset, then tested it and it worked, so I am not sending it in for replacement.I had originally put a 3-star, but since contacting Roku via my Roku account and getting a quick response and direction, and a willingness to replace, I have changed the rating to 5-star. Good follow-up and service.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2020","Mikel",294
"Roku is a Wonderland!","I love this streaming stick. It is my first foray into streaming and it’s rather a Wonderland! It has worked perfectly. I haven’t integrated it with my Echo Dot yet and I don’t think the remote is a voice remote (?) so that’s why I couldn’t rate those two in this review. I read several reviews online before purchasing this Roku streaming stick+ and the reviews were very good and inspired confidence in this little device. So I purchased it and I’m glad I did. The reviews said that you get a lot of bang for the buck and it seems to be true. When you activate it however and it asks you to type in your email address, you have to hit the OK button to go to the next screen. I was confused by that and was trying to use the up-and-down arrows to get down to the area to type in the email address. They should put the words “press OK” because it wasn’t obvious to me that that was what I should do to toggle to the next screen. I wasted a bunch of time trying to figure it out. When in doubt, press OK!!<U+0001F937><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2021","Einia",294

"Works well, customer support is legit","I'm posting this review mostly to document my experience with Roku support. I have three of these in my home, and am pretty happy with how they work. Recently, one of them ""bricked"", not sure if it was due to an update or just hardware failure (after about 7 months of use). Went on Roku and did chat-based support. It took about 30 minutes to walk through the hard reset, restart, etc. steps with the rep that I had already done. When we got to the end of the process, the rep sent me an RMA number and address to mail my Roku stick to. A week, later, I got a replacement. Bottom line, the company stand behind its product.The product hasn't really changed, although I did notice that the remote now has a ""non-slip"" type finish as opposed to the slick glossy finish my previous remotes had (which is a little nicer). Yet to be determined if the remote eats batteries as quickly as the old one.Other than the remote's battery consumption, my only complaint as a multiple device owner has to do with setup. When activating the Roku, I have to go through the whole ""channel selection"" setup again, which is kind of annoying. My devices are registered with Roku, and they should know what I use. It's also painful to have to re-register each channel (Hulu, Netflix, etc.) but I'm guessing that is because of ""differences of opinion"" in how registration should work (i.e. does Hulu trust Roku to act as an authentication proxy).","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2020","Jason",295

"Bad! Drains batteries fast.","Weve had Rokus for years. This one is great as well, minus 1 major problem. It drains batteries within 2 weeks or so with very little use. You'd be spending plenty in batteries over 1 years time. Roku failed. The remote must be ""looking"" for the roku when the TV is off, I cant think of any other reason why the batteries would drain. I have a replacement coming, so we will see if the issue is persistent.Update: Got the new roku stick from Amazon, thanks to their great return policy. Unfortunately it was not a defective issue. Again same problem. The remote kills batteries within a week with little use. Solution? I thought I would move on without the remote and just download the roku app to use my phone as the remote. STILL A FAIL! The app will not ""see"" the Roku stick, and it wont even connect manually using the IP address. What a joke. Come on Roku, the user interface is the most important part of the device. If I dont have a remote control, how can i use it?","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2021","Jon",295

"Great as Always, One Caveat","This is not my first Roku device, nor will it be my last. It works great. The only complaint I have is the included power cable COULD be a little longer for TVs that are mounted, but other than that, the thing works wonderfully.Definitely prefer this product to the Amazon Fire Stick, as the fire stick is very laggy and freezes often.EDITED: I am downing this review a star because it seems Roku is always in fights with streaming providers. Recently they were in fights with Peacock and HBO Max, however that was eventually resolved and their apps were placed on the device.However, now they have gotten into a fight with Youtube TV, so the app as been removed from the device. Luckily, we already had it downloaded so we can still use it, however you can no longer download the Youtube TV app if you are a new user of a Roku device as of May 2021.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2021","Malcolm",296
"Beware of Scam! Dishonest and Deceptive!","Somehow, a company called Caligeeks hijacked my Roku. On 2/8/2020 during the setup of this Roku the screen wouldn't allow me to continue setup unless I called the listed phone # on screen. It took me to a company called Caligeeks who said Roku had changed their policy as Jan 1. Now you had to pay a fee of $79.99 to set up a five year account with them, or $129+ for a lifetime account. They made me believe I couldn't work my Roku without them and that all Roku customers would have to pay this fee each time they bought a Roku. I don't know how their phone # appeared on my Roku, but I argued with them for an hour (since I already had a Roku and knew it was free to set up an account). They had thick accents and were hard to understand on top of it.If Roku is going through a 3rd party for weekend support, there should be information about it upfront instead of lying to customers telling them it's MANDATORY. It's not mandatory. It left a bad taste in my mouth for Roku.Also, the Roku remote was faulty. I messed with it forever and followed all the troubleshooting multiple times and it still didn't work. I was fed up and returned the whole thing, but the device itself seemed to work fine.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2020","Melissa B",296

"Helped us cut the cord!","Am sick and tired of the cable companies and their pricing. But am not going to go into that here. These Roku units have helped us sever the cords and we are not turning back. We got the voice recognition due to the fact that we were hoping for a better search feature. Its ok but not great. The Roku device does provide for a affordable way to watch TV. Multiple channels. and of course if you're not careful you can run up the monthly bill. We are still finding channels that we like. Only complaint so far is the speed seems slow even though we have pretty good (GB) internet.

"Excellent value. Some questions answered here if you're interested.","After a few months of using the cheaper basic Roku, I decided to upgrade to the Streaming Stick+, though I couldn't seem to get answers to some tech questions here or on their website.The video is wonderfully clear when streaming from my desktop computer or when streaming from the Xfinity streaming service - or through the Roku channel for that matter. I think some serious upscaling is going on. The sound is amazing streaming from my computer, but be aware that most streaming services don't broadcast in surround sound - you'll have to settle for stereo until they decide there's enough demand for it.Set up was mostly easy, except that in my case, there was some sort of glitch that caused streaming errors at first. The solution was simple: go into settings and find the ""restart"" option, and then re-install the services you subscribe to.If you rip your own video, you'll find that the Stick won't render vobsubs or PGS subs at all. Those are the subs that come with DVDs and BluRay disks. But you can easily download srt subs from various websites. Streamed movies and TV shows do, of course, have subs that work. The subs are displayed in compact form with a black background for easy reading without getting in the way of opening credits.And here's the question nobody could answer for me: The stick WILL handle the x265 HEVC codec. This is a real advantage if you rip your own video from your disks. HEVC will pack some great clarity into much smaller files.One thing I don't like, is the menu navigation in the media app (where it streams from your computer in the other room). When you go into a folder, and then come back out, the other folders are sometimes not displayed. The solution is to go ""home"" and then enter the app again. Then you can select from all the content. The same bug was in the cheap Roku, so I think they don't know about it.Given the price, this is a compact workhorse that will deliver your entertainment reliably in hi-def. Pretty much anything I watch from now on will come through this little stick, except for when I play a physical disk.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2019","G. B.

"Less Heat","I like this 2019 Roku Stick + better than the previous (2017) version primarily because it puts off less heat. The previous stick version would physically get very hot. Then intermittently a warning would come up on the screen that it was overheating.To resolve that, the power had to be cut to let it cool down. I purchased a USB hub with power buttons to do that daily. So far the new version has not felt as hot to the touch nor has a warning popped up.The new version also has a small box integrated into the USB power cord. This may be the resolution for the heat problem.Other than that, this new version also has includes a mute button on the remote. It is supposed to have a quad core processor. I have not noticed any significant speed increase how it operates. I will say that the sticks have 802.11ac network capability that makes them run better than the Roku Express. which only has up to 802.11n network speed.As for voice recognition, that does not work as well as I would hope. Many times it does not recognize what I am saying. So I don’t use it.I purchased many of these for home and as gifts as they were on sale in December for $29 each, which was a good deal. I have had good feedback from others that it works well.I recommend the Roku Stick + of you want a fast, cooler streaming channel device.By the way, as of this time, the CBS Roku app will not allow use without a CBS ALL ACCESS subscription. The smart phone app does allow broadcast show access at no extra cost, which can be streamed to a Google Chromecast device, not to Roku. That is CBS’ choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2020","Buckeye_Knight",298

"The REMOTES are JUNK in less than one year!?!?!","Update on 7/25/2020:2 Remotes have quit working within 8 months of my purchase. I have replaced batteries, tried to resync and nothing solves the issue. We now have to use my cell phone and Roku app in 2 different rooms of our home just to use the streaming sticks which are our only source of TV news and movies. I purchased 2 replacement devices about one month thinking I was giving us backup devices and now I am past their return window and I know those remotes are going to crap out on me too...NOT HAPPY with dropping a total of $250+ when the remotes last less than 1 year.Update on 01/07/2020:We now have three if these because our Daughter’s “smart” TV that is just over a year old suddenly decided to have issues with all of the built in apps. This stick is perfect for those who have this happen, or have a TV without built in apps, or those like me who used their game system for streaming until too much use fried an expensive console and caused the loss of hundreds and hundreds of hours of save game data! I recommend these to everyone because they are perfect for our streaming only household.Orig Review:Okay...I absolutely fried my PS4 because as much as I would use it to game on I would also use it to fire up my Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, etc. I never checked into these types of devices before because I guess I just thought my PS4 would be eternal (LOL). As all things tech related eventually do, my PS4 completely crashed and hundreds of hours on my games were lost to me, but in that awful sad moment I decided to replace my PS4 AND go ahead and buy 2 of these to use here at home so that our XBox One wouldn't suffer the same fate in our living room. I know...I'm terrible, huh?Anyways - ROKU. LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT! So easy to setup, easy to add apps to your menu, easy to navigate, quick to load the apps and most important of all I no longer have to worry about using my gaming consoles as entertainment beyond the games they are meant to play! Win Win!!!!I am seriously amazed at how quick the apps launch/load - it's darn near immediate and the interface is clean and easy to use. I love that I can add apps/manage everything from anywhere even when I'm not at home - adding and removing channels is a breeze. It even recognized our TVs without any issues and even some of the universal TV remotes we've bought cannot do that as efficiently as the ROKU did. We are definitely going to be long-time ROKU fans and will buy new ones when needed because they are well worth the price. My husband loves the one in the living room and he has never watched as much TV as he has since I installed the ROKU out there. If we had more TVs we would have more ROKU's.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2019","LittleAche",298

"Overall good","I had the original Roku and that worked fine but didn't like using 2 remotes to still have the ability to change the volume, etc.. This new one solves that problem but the sensor is behind the TV as its part of the HDMI connection. So sometimes I need to ""aim"" it just right. It also takes a few minutes to load for some reason. Same WiFi as my old set and that was quick-- this one can be spotty at times. Jury is still out on this one.I will say-- Why can't Roku make a remote that lights up? very annoying that in this day and age the remote doesn't simply illuminate so when watching with the lights out you can quickly find the pause button.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2020","CCWT",299

"Amazing picture","Late last year I broke my 1080p tv. Luckily was able to get a brand new 4k tv a few months later. At first I thought since it was a 4k smart tv I could watch 4k movies. Man was I wrong. Learned only select devices can no matter the tv. So I knew it was time for a new Roku player (had a gen 1 so didn't look good even on 4k). After shopping around and asking questions I went with the Roku streaming stick+. I love it. It even makes non 4k movies and shows look amazing. For the price its so worth it. I was nervous at first because I read my 4k tv needed hdcp 2.2 hdmi outlets or else at best would be 1080p and I couldn't find anything in the manual and behind the tv to say it did. But found out through research my tv did.What is also nice is the fact its not a box, its a stick that goes into a hdmi port (rather then hdmi cable connecting the two) so less clutter on the shelf. Also you don't need to aim the remote directly at it to use it. You can be in front of a wall and it would work. So no need to worry about where you stick it in the tv (for me the hdmis were behind the tv and not on the side). It is your typical Roku player, has the same apps as the first gen plus any 4k apps (there is a section for it). Also some of the apps (Netflix, hulu) looks completely different then their older model counterparts so had to get used to it.The remote is your standard Roku. Same set up with some very nice features. If you sync it to your tv you can turn off the tv without tv remote and even control the volume (volume controls are on the side) so makes it easier versus using two remotes. A very nice feature is audio control. Kind of like siri or alexxa.. You push the button and make a command to open an app or search for a movie, show or app.Overall the pros are great and cons are nothing to worry about. Id do some research before buying to make sure your tv has the right hdmi ports or else you spent more money on the same thing as a cheap model for non 4k tvs. Defiantly recommend.Pros:-amazing picture for both 4k and hd-No box-don't need to aim remote at device-price-remote features-voice controlCons:-needs a specific hdmi for it to work-some apps are different then the ones on other Roku models","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2018","Thomas A.

"Works well. For watching regular TV, no difference when compared with the Roku Ultra.","We have a Roku Ultra. We moved the TV and there was no convenient place to put the box other than adhering it to the back of the TV along with the thick HDMI cable. It was not neat. We bought the Roku Steaming Stick+ which does not require an HDMI cable. It does require 5V power via USB. The TV had a powered USB port. We plugged the Stick+ into the HDMI port and the USB power cable into the TV's USB port, and it works great. I see no difference in capability of picture quality between the Ultra and Streaming Stick+. Granted we are not viewing 4k video or doing anything special or technical.Keep in-mind that the USB port on the TV may not be powered on all of the time. Ours is not so when we turn the TV off the Roku powers down. This is not a problem for us. We don't mind waiting for the Roku to power up every time we turn on the TV.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2021","DMc",300

"Very disappointing. A super slow device","The sound is reasonable but the hardware is extremely weak.I used to have Roku Streaming Stick+ (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075XLWML4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) in my office. I wanted to improve the sound in the small room so I purchased this one.The sound is actually OK. Nothing professional but quite good for this small cheap device.But the hardware is embarrassingly weak. This causes extremely annoying lag. You press a bottom on the remote and it take 2-3 second for anything to happen. The stream itself is also lagging and at times reports there is no wifi connection, which is a nonsense. It never happened with the previous device and my phone has wifi. You need to reboot this thing every few hours or it gets slower and slower.Roku clearly saved money on the hardware in this device and it showed.I returned mine and went back to the stick. It's working well.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2021","CMH guy",301

"Best Collection of streamings Apps for the buck, Lousy Internet connection","For the money, Roku has the greatest palette of apps - HBOMax, Apple TV and so many more. However, they appear to have equipped this Streaming Stick+ with the cheapest, weakest WiFi receiver possible. We have high-speed Spectrum cable internet, and our router is right in the living room with our TV, about 12 feet away. All our devices (computer, iPad, phones, etc.) show full bars anywhere in that room, and the LG OLED TV itself has no trouble getting a strong signal on any other app - Netflix, Prime Video, etc.Yet the Roku stick, plugged into the HDMI port on the side of the TV, showed a weak connection of only 3 out of 5 bars, and buffered miserably upon watching. Moving the router within 5’ got us up to 4 bars and less connection glitches. Getting up to a strong 5-bar signal required moving our router RIGHT NEXT TO the TV.Unacceptable, period, for a 2021 WiFi-dependent streaming device...so cannot recommend.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2021","Rhythm Earthsong",301
"Simple, enjoyable interface","It's hard not to love the Roku Streaming Stick. The beauty of this device is its simplicity. Plug it directly into your TV's HDMI and USB ports, and you're done. The interface is wonderfully uncluttered. So many competitors have allowed their streaming devices to become a convoluted mess. The remote is a joy to use and worked perfectly with my TV and external sound bar, right out of the box. Roku boasts the largest selection of channels available for any streaming service. Of course I only have a few of them actually downloaded but the flexibility of choice is a huge plus. The one area that I feel needs work is on the speed of the interface. It is starting to show some signs of age and is just not quite as snappy as it could be. Still, it's a very worthwhile streaming device and in my opinion, the best available.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2021","J.W. McGhee",301

If the last connected device is not on, Roku is not smart enough to scan for the 2nd wifi connection. When it is searching for the 1st wireless connection it locks up the entire system for 2-3 minutes while it tries to connect. You can't use the back button, search for new wifi, etc until it finally gives up. It is a major pain when I have to switch between Wifi/Hotspot connections. Every other digital device I have ever owned knows to scan previous used wifi connections if the first one is not available.

"Can't receive Dolby Digital 5.1","I could not get the stick to stream with Dolby Digital 5.1 sound. I am not sure if it was defective from the get-go or if it became defective subsequently, but because I didn't notice it until recently, I suspect it became defective later. I tried to get support from Roku but failed because of the way they support their products. For one thing, they have NO telephone support. All they have is a forum, chatting, and bizarre e-mail support. All of the previous forms of support were useless. Unfortunately, although the product is covered by a one-year warranty, you cannot get a refund after 30 days. At best, you can get a replacement as long as you pay shipping costs, and based on what I've seen on the web about Roku's sound issues, I think it's more likely software-related than hardware-related, so even a replacement would probably not fix the issue.I originally replaced a Fire TV stick I had with the Roku. I have removed the Roku and put back the Fire TV stick, which is able to get Dolby Digital 5.1 with no problem.Unless you don't care about sound or customer support, do not buy this product.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2021","Rjs",301

"Overheats on Amazon HDR shows - free extension cord helped","This is an update to my earlier review (see below). I received the free extension cord from Roku, and it did solve the problem, so I have upgraded my rating to four stars. But since Roku is well aware of the problem, they should be supplying this cord with all shipments so that customers don't have to waste a lot of time sorting out the issue.I was not aware of this before I bought it, but evidently this device is not adequately designed to dissipate heat very well. This shows up whenever we watch something with HDR on Amazon Prime. Evidently Amazon HDR makes the stick work extra hard and heat builds up to the point where you get an onscreen warning that the unit is overheating. Netflix shows are fine. Roku has a ""fix"" where they'll send you a free extension cord to try to move the device farther away from the TV, but according to a number of users on the Roku users group, this does not always fix the problem. I have sent for the extension cord, but in the meantime, we can't watch Amazon HDR shows.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2020","James M Bathgate",302

"Have things changed?","Reviews from 2018 suggested that Roku was charging $79 per additional Roku to update and activate more than two of their devices. I ordered this from Amazon and two more from Best Buy and had no difficulty activating any of them. All work well. I gave it four stars in part because my wife's hands are shaky and I could not find a Roku remote with large buttons that would do everything that the included manufacturer's remote does. Also because (in part) the voice search is not currently working when signed into an app -- and it was working until a few days ago. And also because at the time of this review they had not worked out a contract with Spectrum to include their app. Roku is now saying in the ad for this device that there is no charge for support ""of any kind."" Nor have I had any problems with respect to upgrading the software. So four stars instead of three.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2021","Guy",303

"About a tie with Fire Stick","(I have reviewed the Fire Stick, since I have purchased both, unable to make up my mind which one I wanted for my 2 smart TVs). This device has performed flawlessly, although it helps I have the best available residential internet service (Cox Gigablast), cable modem (Arris SB8200) and wifi mesh router (Orbi, with 3 satellites). Comparing the remote to the one sold with the Fire Stick, I prefer the layout of buttons on the Fire Stick. The voice button on the Roku remote is hard to find, located in the middle among other buttons. And the volume buttons are tiny, located on the side where it is too easy to hit the mute button inadvertently. The large, conspicuous buttons for Netflix, Disney, Hulu, and Sling are nice (since I subscribe to 3 of these services), but are redundant since most of us prefer voice. Both remotes badly need buttons that light up in the night, similar to the Cox Contour remote I just gave up. Highly recommend either Stick; you might select based on slight differences of contracted streaming services and whether you need without extra cost an HDMI extension adapter (I did with my Samsung), which for now only comes with the Fire Stick.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2020","8clap",305

"Roku streaming stick Perfect for a non-smart tv with HDMI port","I know there was some issues with the remote not working, but mine only seemed to be a battery issue. I put new batteries in and it works as it should. You can also download an app remote that works great for typing in the search as well as being able to plug in head phones and listen privately from my phone. It works great so far and is my third Roku product. The other older two continue to work great. I can’t say about the Alexa integration as I have not attempted to utilize that tool. It sits flush with the HDMI port in my LG tv (it’s not a smart tv) and does not have to be plugged in to an electrical outlet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2021","Rene E",306

"We use Roku Streaming Stick as a backup","For nearly 10 years, we've used the full Roku unit, never a stick version. However, because portability is something I was looking for, getting the stick seemed to be preferred choice to be able to use it on different TV's or carry it for travel. Without a discount or sale, I find Roku pricey compared to its competitors.In any case, setting up the Roku stick was about as tedious as a full console unit. I find it tedious because there is no keyboard to enter characters upon set up. But once you get past that, the Roku stick is pretty awesome. You can use an app to control the stick also.Unlike the Amazon stick which has a chintzy weak-feel remote, the Roku stick has a great feel and solid remote.

"Works Great! Happy Cordcutter Here","Recently decided to cut the cable cord and go with Roku + YouTube TV. So far things are fantastic for my use. The Roku is easy to install and set up. Platform agnostic with a very nice and snappy menu user interface.There is room for improvement with the remote control + YouTube TV guide controls, I would like to be able to do more voice commands like ""Watch CNN on YouTube TV"" etc. You can't do that yet. Also a little confusing if you hit the wrong button on the remote it might take you out of the YouTube TV app and back to the main menu. Once you figure out what does what, it's pretty straightforward. Hopefully they work on making it even better and intuitive. These services are still pretty new, so things are still being developed and getting dialed in. Otherwise it works very well and I'm saving on my monthly bill while still getting all the channels and services I need.I wish the remote control was rubberized, it's hard plastic and kind of small and slippery. Also wish the buttons were backlit so I can see what I'm doing in the dark at night.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2020","Elliott S.",307

"Sleek, Convenient and Efficient","I really appreciate the convenience of the streaming stick, and Roku overall. This is my sixth Roku device and third streaming stick. I originally purchased a Roku after I switched from a traditional cable provider to YouTube TV. My Smart TV didn't have the firmware/hardware to support YouTube TV. Instead of buying a new TV, I bought a Roku express.. and then I bought two more. After changing the look of a number of different rooms, I ended up mounting every TV I owned. I ended up switching from the Express to the Streaming stick due to its ability to be hidden behind a TV and draw power from the TV via a USB cable. I'm glad I did. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to remove the amount of clutter, cables and connections. The remote supplied with the streaming stick also has the ability to control your TV's functions (on/off and volume). So again, you won't really need your TV's remote with this device. Overall though, from my experience, I would recommend the Roku brand. Especially if your TV is lacking the software or hardware to support the latest streaming technologies. A Roku will turn any TV with an HDMI port into an up-to-date device.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2020","Claire Mia",307

"Nice upgrade from Fire TV","I got fed up with The constant “low storage” notifications from my Fire TVs and decided to try a Roku. After setting it up I immediately bought 2 more and ditched all my Fire TVs. Overall experience is a bit cleaner since you’re not constantly beaten over the head with Prime Video recommendations and banner ads. The app sign in experience seems better overall and the companion app is a huge step up over FTV. The private listening feature is an unexpected winner for me, it allows you to shift the audio from the Roku to your phone which is great for late night viewing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2021","Fuzz Ears",308
"It's Roku. It works. Worth buying if you want Roku","I have another Roku in the family room and wanted one to go with the portable projector I bought. This integrated well with it but there was some initial irrigation getting the Roku remote to work with the device and connecting it to our wifi extender. The main complaint I have is that it's totally a bummer as Alexa integration is pretty limited and not really a selling point. The voice remote is kind of stupid because you still have to actually hold the remote in your hand so at that point you should just use it as a remote because the voice recognition isn't as great as other smart devices. All up for the price it's worthwhile. I can't honestly say it streams any better than my 4 year old Roku device but than I'm no expert.

I ordered this one for an older smart TV it was easy to connect to the WiFi, and aside from having to log into all of my apps (which you have to do for any new device like this) it was great. Roku has a mobile app as well, so i can use my phone as a remote, and i can plug my headphones into the app to listen as well.

"Love the Stick!","I have a couple of Roku TVs and one Roku box on another TV. This Roku stick is my favorite. It handles the Xfinity software like a champ, much faster than the Roku TV does. Perfect reception a floor away from the wireless router.Very easy to install and takes up no room behind the TV. This is a winner. You don't need to buy the Roku box. This stick does it all.I do not use Alexa so cannot speak to the voice control feature.I will note that the Roku home page will not list an external antenna as an option with the stick. You only seem to get that option on a Roku TV. So if you use an external antenna, you'll have to use your TV's remote to scroll channels. (The Roku remote controls the listings on the Roku home page.)I don't know if it will list cable on the Roku menu if the TV is connected to a cable box because my TV receives cable via Xfinity's software, not a box. That option shows up on the Roku home page as ""Xfinity.""If the TV is also connected to a Blu-ray player, that shows up on the Roku home page as whatever HDMI port it's connected to, e.g., ""HDMI 2.""

"Better than an Apple TV & Amazon Fire Stick","So I have an apple TV and amazon fire stick. But this roku streaming + stick is better than both. The navigation interface is a lot more intuitive than the amazon fire stick but maybe not as elegant as the apple tv.PROS- Easy to set up- Tons of free streaming content- Remote controls TV- Strong Connection- Bluetooth headset connection so no need for wired headsets. Use the bluetooth headsets you have.- Can cast your ios photos, videos, and music to your tv.Cons- The remote keeps randomly losing connection. I have to remove the batteries and put it back in to get it to reconnect.- The voice search doesn't work in different apps. So you can't be in Youtube or hulu and use voice search to search for content. It has to be used in the main Roku menu.- There is no mute button. This shouldn't be an extra feature you need to pay for.- The bluetooth headset connection can be spotty and it doesn't connect directly to the roku stick. Instead it's connecting to the app on your smartphone. So I don't know if that's the issue.- Can't mirror your ios device on the screen like an apple tv.Despite these cons, I still plan to purchase others. But I need a resolution to the remote control issue before I do that.

Our stick came complete, set up was easy and straightforward and it works great. We subscribe to several streaming services (Netflix, Amazon Prime, CBS All Access, Sling, Disney+ etc. and the free ones, YouTube and Roku) but our bill is still only 1/2 of what it was with cable. We have good internet so there is no buffering problems. We have way more TV to watch now, in part because we like educational and documentary type material and don’t mind an old movie or original content.

Each time, the stick was very hot. I followed the ""Unplug & wait 10 minutes until the unit is cool"" directions. My TV sits on a cabinet. There are no other electronic devices near the TV and there's 10 inches between the back of the TV and the wall.

"Include HDMI adapter in the box","In fairness I am giving this 1 star based on my experience so far of trying to install the Roku stick since I haven't been able to test my new Roku. Because of the poor design of having the power cable connect on the side of the Roku stick it is sure to cause interference problems on many TV's (mine included). Roku must know this is an issue since in the instructions they note that if it doesn't fit they will ship you a free adapter 4-5 days after you discover you can't use your Roku stick. Including the adapter in the box would have been a nice customer satisfier even if it is not needed for some installations. However, it is a major dissatisfier to not include it and make customers wait another 5 days to get their product workable. Hopefully the stick will perform better than the installation process (once I get my adapter next week), but not impressed with Roku so far.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2018","Steve",309
"BUY IT! IT WORKS GREAT! SIMPLE TO USE 4K 60FPS YES! HDR, YES! DOLBY ATMOS, YES!","I bought this from Amazon to use with my LG OLED TV. I wanted something that would support all that my LG TV can be. This stick is amazing. It's very easy to set up. The setup is quick. We like the large menu display (we are in our 60s). We were watching shows in ten minutes flat! It helps to register online using your computer first then sync your account with the stick. It will ask to do that so just follow the directions. Then it will do an automatic update to the latest firmware. Adding content is easy from you computer or directly from the TV screen. It's super easy.Signal strength is very strong for us. Picture quality is excellent. Sound quality, also excellent. No latency or video slowing or stopping.I had to fix one thing during setup because of my ignorance. The stick recognized 4K at 30fps but I know my LG can do 4K at 60fps. A quick google showed me I needed to pair the HDMI slot with the HDR LG deep color setting which I did and re-ran setup. The stick then recognized 4K at 60fps. Problem solved.By the way there are many, many free channels and live channels along with all the standard premium content offered by Roku. All easily accessible from Roku's simple menu. If you are looking to break from cable, this Roku stick will greatly aid in that endeavor.I am very happy with the Roku stick plus.Buy it.

I'd love to cut the cord but...I ordered this for my bedroom and so far it works great and saves me 10 bucks a month. Setup was easy, signal is good with no issue's thus far. The Xfinity app works well but the Roku remote has no number keys on it so changing channels is a bit more difficult. I have started storing all my usual channels in Favorites so that makes it easier to get to the channel I want. One issue is the ""stick"" has a little light on it so at night I see the glow from behind my TV, just letting you know in case you need complete darkness at night while sleeping. Everything else like Netflix and Amazon work great.I'll update if any issue's occur but so far so good.

"Mostly great - one really big flaw","I always need a roku, even with a SmartTV, because of the number of apps available. I have been a loyal user since the first version of the box.I'm happy with this stick except for one small thing (and i do mean small): the power cord is really, really short. Unbelievably short. Unless your TV sits on the ground right next to the power outlet (with the wall outlet fortunately on the same side of the television as the HDMI ports), this cannot be plugged in without a weighty extension cord, which will put strain on the device. Not sure what they were thinking. Surely one of the designers must own an actual television and realize that it's very rare for an HDMI port to be only 3 feet or less from a wall outlet. You either need to get a longer M-F HDMI cable in which to plug the stick, or you can do as I did and plug the stick into a switcher and plug the switcher directly into the TV's HDMI port. There is really no way to plug the stick directly into the TV.Hopefully they'll figure out what a tragic mistake they've made and provide a significantly longer power cord next time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2019","Kay_Rock",310

"Handy Device - BUT a ""Range Extender"" Needed in my Situation","I am satisfied with the performance of the Roku Stick+, though it did require the addition of a wifi ‘range extender’ to improve reception. The device converts my ‘dumb’ TV to a ‘smart’ TV, allowing access to a wide variety of viewing options, including Spectrum, Netflix, etc. I can now use my laptop exclusively for work, while watching a TV program. A nice addition.I am not sure why the Roku device needs a signal booster to perform properly since my laptop (used next to the TV) and all other device work fine. When first installed, the Roku Stick+ wifi screen reported “POOR” signal strength. After the addition of the range extender (purchased some time ago on Amazon for about $20) the signal strength is now “EXCELLENT”. A bit confusing since the extender is located next to the TV in what would be considered an ‘undesirable’ location: floor level, between appliances, and horizontal. But, it works!The “Roku Stick+” is a replacement for the less expensive “Roku Stick” which failed to reliably connect: poor picture quality and frequent “reloading . . .” (buffering).","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2018","Stefan Wajs",310
"Decent UX marred by performance and compatibility issues","Well, after a week of troubleshooting attempts, I've thrown in the towel and decided to return this, my first Roku product. While the UX is quite good (fast, reasonably well designed), and the feature set is appealing, there were two problems for me that led to this outcome:1. Surround sound issue due to lack of Dolby Digital support for older equipmentDuring my fall into the Roku support forum rabbit hole, I learned that there are two varieties of Dolby surround: Dolby Digital (DD) and Dolby Digital Plus (DD+). Providers such as Disney+ provide surround audio in DD+, but not DD; my older receiver (a Denon) can't decode the former, so I only get stereo audio from those programs. Competing streaming devices apparently can convert DD+ to DD in these cases, but the Roku can't (in spite of what the available device settings would lead you to believe). Comments in the forums suggest that some older Roku models can perform this conversion, and that this product used to until recent Roku updates.As a work-around, I routed the Roku through my Blu-ray player, which can process DD+ streams. Not as convenient, but not a deal-breaker on its own.2. Video stutters after rewind on Netflix, Disney +I've observed this problem on Netflix and Disney +, on multiple shows. (I hadn't tried any other services.) Typically, when I play a program for the first time, motion is pretty smooth; no noticeable artifacts. However, If I rewind the program a bit and then play, I see a choppiness that seems to be a frozen frame every 1/4 sec. or so. This is most noticeable on pans and slow zooms. (Some might describe this as a stutter.) The effect is sufficiently severe to make this a deal-breaker for me.I went through the troubleshooting steps covered on the support forums, with no success. I also have a Comcast X1 box with Netflix; I tested the same shows on that device, but could not reproduce the problem there. So it sure seems that the problem lies with the Roku.So, given all of the above, I'm giving up on this product. Customers with more recent gear might not encounter the problems I did, but for others this would be something to consider before choosing this as your streaming device.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2020","Mitch Y",310

I hooked it up to my Samsung TV and added all my streaming apps. It's perfect to have all my options on one input, on one device. I can stream my Comcast content, and access all my streaming services. The voice control works fine, but it doesn't work as an input method for every app. I also need to get used to how to FF and RWD with the remote, since it's so basic, it acts a little different that I am used to.

"Buyer beware. Not as good as old fire TV sticks. Remote fails and fails and fails. . .","Lots of problems with function. I was really looking forward to Roku being better than our Fire TV sticks. A cousin talked Roku up so I bought one. I am not happy with it.First off, the remote fails to connect to the Roku stick EVERY TIME I USE IT. I have to carry the remote to the TV, take off the remote cover and push the pairing button several times to get it to work. I have paired the remote several times it does not help.Also, the Roku often gets the time alignment messed up -- sound and video do not match. The sound it a couple of seconds behind the video. To fix this I have to turn off the TV unhook the Roku. Reinstall the Roku and restart the TV. It's not a big deal, except that I have to do this a few times a week. This NEVER happens, or has happened with firetv sticks.I have contacted Roku support three times with no real help. They're very confusing on customer service and tech support. All done in emails.

After resetting the firetv sticks and reinstalling apps, these years old streaming sticks run circles around the Roku for less money.Update 6/2021 -- we are currently waiting on the arrival of remote NUMBER THREE. Not remote one which arrived with huge problems; not remote number two which gave a year plus of service, but remote number three. I have never replaced a remote with any other device -- ever.If you like a fresh remote every year or so buy a Roku. Me? I'm back on the fire stick and loving it!","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2019","DAT",311

"Works as expected except I might be an idiot","Works as expected except I might be an idiot. I for some reason. Thought this was a cord free version of the Roku. I ordered these so I could put them in my kids room without worrying about them ripping any power cords out of the walls or anything like that cause kids will be kids. I realized it clearly and obviously needs a power source somehow. I guess I thought it was powered somehow through the TV itself but moral of the story is it’s not. And it needs a power source and I had a complete blank moment in common sense for that.Long story short. Works as expected, I love the remotes having tv controls for volume and powering the tv on and off and the kids love being able to talk to the remotes!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2021","Velinalynn",311

I had the original roku several years ago, even gave a few as gifts, but I have had nothing but problems with the roku stick. For the past week every time I sit down to watch something I have to do my own research, tech support and maintenace and I am tired of it. The audio stopped working, searched online because due to ""Covid"" no phone support. Could not get directed to email support because my problem was not listed.

"Responsive with a clean user interface","Back story of why I purchased it. The Sony TV in the living room is a smart tv that is getting old. The smart functions take a long time to load and the tv is not very responsive when trying to scan on Netflix or Hulu. I have an Amazon Firestick which works very well but is very cluttered with Amazon services and adds. My girlfriend wanted something easier to find the apps she wanted and something easier for her 7 year old to use. So I did some research and ended up buying this. Setup is easy and the UI is clean. After some tweaking to the UI I have the most used apps at the beginning and the least used apps at the end. I also was able to delete apps that I didn’t want on the Roku, which I think is great. The remote has 4 buttons on it and they are Netflix, Hulu, Disney+ and Sling TV, 3 of the 4 services we use so that was a very nice plus. The volume buttons work wonderfully. We can turn the TV on and off using the remote power button as well. The picture is clear and crisp and it’s being powered off the TV’s USB port. All in we are very happy with this device and I recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2020","Timothy",312

"Great Streaming Device!","I bought a Roku for my mother a couple of months ago. She was looking to cut her cable but didn't know any alternatives to traditional cable. I did some research, and I saw that for people like my mother, who were used to conventional television and had no clue how to use streaming devices, Roku has the best user interface. The application buttons on the remote mean 9 times out of 10, my mother doesn't even have to navigate the menu! She just clicks a button, and she is in the app!Now fast forward to a couple of weeks ago. I decided I wanted a Roku for my bedroom television. I picked this up and wouldn't you know that my TV is a 4k television and I had no clue! I bought the thing like three years ago, and I used it primarily to play my switch on there. So I am now using my TV to its full potential. The remote has those same helpful buttons and the addition of the voice remote AND Alexa integration. So for those days when I am feeling extra lazy and don't care about looking for the remote, I can yell at my TV.All in all, for me, it has been a pleasant experience. I would recommend Roku to anyone who is looking to stream in one place on their television.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2020","ZE Panda",312
"Not what it seems","When I tried to activate the Roku Firestick on my TV, the attempt failed. When I contacted the vendor via the phone number given in the instructions, the Amazon Vendor attempted to collect $90.00 to activate the Roku fire stick. The explanation was that I already had one Roku unit and the new Roku policy would require a one time activation fee of $90.00. I refused and hung up. Several minutes later the vendor called and offered to activate the device for $45.00. Knowing this was a scam, I decided to pay the $45.00 because he offered to help me set up the device for PBS Passport. I realize that I accepted the scam for expediency. The device itself works great. The 1 star is for the total experience. Amazon should be aware of this type of scam.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2020","Charles E.

The problem is that they only support English, German, Spanish, French and Portuguese. No asian languages. They support more subtitles in addition to the above languages they support Russian, Turkish, Polish, Ukrainian, Romanian, Dutch, Croatian, Hungarian, Greek, Czech and Sweedish.

Although my plasma still has great picture, it does not have Smart/Streaming capabilities. So I ordered the Roku 4k stick and it worked perfectly. It was pretty much plug and play and the setup was straight forward. The Roku stick recognized my old Plasma and the remote can turn on and off the Plasma TV, along with volume adjustments. Now my kids have a new Smart TV where they can stream their favorite shows and movies.

"Fetch this Stick!","Over the years, we've purchased pretty much every Roku plug-in device on the market, given handfuls of them away as gifts to family and friends, and kept the newest ones for ourselves. This one is a breeze to use, it popped into our 4K television and worked like a charm, right off the bat. At first I was a little concerned on two counts - first, the TV we have has its USB ports recessed, so the Roku Streaming Stick had to accommodate a bit of an angle; it took perhaps an extra 30-40 seconds to finesse it in without doing any damage to the Stick or the TV, but it worked. The second potential issue was the fact that the USB port for this particular television is in the back, and I was afraid that its location would interfere with the remote's operation. Nope - a breeze. As with the other models, this streamer seemingly has unlimited channel capacity, so you can grab as many new channels as you need. The remote also has the headphone jack to allow you to watch television without bothering others in the room. In all, this was a great purchase. I cannot say enough great things about the Roku family of streamers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2018","Misha",313

The Roku was super-easy to connect and set up--much easier than I imagined it would be, given the circumstances.

"Great streaming with enhanced wifi","I bought this stick because after I extended my home network, I discovered that my older Roku premier stick was not compatible with the extender a.c. network while streaming Hulu. But now that I have it, I am really appreciating it. The stick is RF so the unit in the HDMI slot does not have to be visible to my remote. There is new functionality as the remote now controls the on/off of my TV and JBL soundbar, as well as the volume (things my Roku Premier never did). In addition, there is a new Wi-Fi booster on the stick that picks up the signal from farther way and enhances it. This means my Hulu Live stream has never looked better. Everything looks better, and sounds great too. Setup was easy, and I now have two Streaming Stick+ running on both of my TVs, living room and bedroom.

Alas, got through the installation, only to find that the ""Roku enhanced remote is designed to control volume and power for your TV. It cannot directly control other devices connected to your TV, such as an audio/video receiver (AVR) or soundbar."" Well, now you tell me! Apparently you may be able to have Roku send volume to your TV that can send it to the soundbar, but my older TV/Bose won't support that.So the good news is that my guests will get the streaming stick with one remote for the TV in the guest bedroom.

But, after reading they had upgraded the firmware AND rethinking my whole setup around my TV, I decided to give it another go. I have to say that I think part of the whole reliability issue was my setup. It simply did not dawn on me how many other WiFi devices were so close to the TV, many of which I never use. I had 1) an old Wi player still on, 2) a WiFi enabled DVD player still on, 3) a WiFi enabled amp, 4) a WiFi enabled cable set top box, and 5) the stick. That's enough to drive any device insane. So, after deciding to either disable or remove what wasn't being used, the stick worked flawlessly. I honestly have not had one little flicker of trouble.

I unplugged the stick to let it cool down, put it in again and within 20 minutes the message reappears that it is overheated.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2021","movie lover",317
"Done with Chromecast","I bought this because I don't have an HD receiver in my bedroom and I want to stream sports in HD quality to my HD TV in my bedroom. My family used to be able to watch sports on the one TV in the house with an HD receiver, but we have had family members move in and completely ruin the experience. I have used Chromecast for years, and there have been so many issues with it but it generally worked well enough. But since football season started, I have been especially frustrated with a lack of smooth streaming, and I knew I couldn't go through a whole football season struggling with streaming issues. To top it off, we switched several months ago from slow DSL to a much faster ISP, and we should not be having the same types of streaming issues at all...but we were, at least with respect to Chromecast performance.So, I decided to look up Roku and I was curious about what channel apps were available. I read that any channel that has an app would be available on Roku, so that was good enough for me and I purchased it. It has worked great...very few streaming issues at all, and the little bit that exist clear up pretty fast and then you have a smooth streaming experience.A few problems, though, most of which have been fixed/worked around at this time:1) The BTN2Go app does not play live TV. It says, ""This video is currently unavailable. Please check back later"" every time. Thankfully, you can watch the Big Ten Network through the Fox Sports app.2) It takes a little too long for each app to start up. This is pretty annoying when you're trying to flip back and forth between various games.3) Roku does not, in fact, have every app associated with streaming live TV. If you want to watch CBS and CBS Sports Network games, it's pretty hard to do so because Roku does not have the actual CBS Sports app. They have this crappy, worthless CBS Sports HQ app that does not show any games, and they have the CBS app that expects you to pay monthly to stream CBS programming. Yet, the CBS Sports app and the CBS Sports site both let you stream SEC games and games on CBS Sports Network (usually AAC and military academy games) for free. I spent hours on Saturday trying to figure out how I can get around this issue and finally figured out how to mirror my laptop screen to Roku. But I really had to dig around online for this info. I really would rather not have to mirror my laptop at all for games; I'd like the real CBS Sports app to be available on Roku.4) It's pretty annoying how every time you want to use an app for the first time that requires your TV cable subscription info, you have to go to your phone or PC/laptop and go to some link to get access.5) I did have an issue with the Roku connecting and disconnecting repeatedly when I first hooked it up and went through set up. Once I reset the stick, unplugged it and plugged it back in and went through setup again, this issue was resolved.--After getting these issues figured out, except for the slow app load times, there's nothing wrong with Roku at all--it's the best $60 or $70 you'll ever spend. Great video quality and great performance. It has saved my football season, and probably my basketball, tennis, softball, etc, seasons, as well. It works so well that it's easy to leave it on and stream up my internet bandwidth usage because I forget it's not the actual cable. It just streams seamlessly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2018","sayock",317

"Had remote problems initially.","I plugged it into a year old 58"" 4K Samsung T.V., and it plugged into a recess in the back cover, parallel to the screen, versus sticking out in back, and I initially had problems with the Remote. It just didn't see it, until I went up to the T.V. and held the remote around the right side edge of the screen, then it was able to make inputs. I found a block in the Manual that indicated if it didn't fit well, they would send an ""Extension Cable"" for the stick, which I immediately ordered. Until it arrived about 5 days later, the Remote worked about 50% of the time, and the others I had to go and hold it around the edge. Since the extension cable arrived, and I installed it between the Stick and the T.V., it works fine. So if you get one, I suggest you order the ""Free Extension Cable"" too. The streaming is fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2019","L. Timonen",317

"Fix my flickering problem with my previous ROKU","I was using a 4k Roku Ulta with my Onkyo Amp as Pass Thru. It flicker a lot and I am not sure is it the cable I had or what causes the problem. (it does'n't flicker with my other TV that I connected straight to it) So I purchase this 4k Stick when it was on sale and it solved the problem. At first I was afraid the wireless won't be fast enough to handle 4k quality Pic content, but I wouldn't see the difference compare to my ultra connected with wired connection.Update 07/28/2020The Roku Streaming Sticks + started to randomly restarts itself like 10 times a day. I know that is not normal with Roku. I contacted Roku and they are willing to do a replacement with me. I don't like they will have me pay the shipping and ship it off to them before I can get a replacement. So I had a week without having a Roku in my living room to watch shows with.

"Great reception at a distance from wireless access point","I always read reviews, check out review sites like TechRadar... After reading many glowing reviews on the Roku Streaming Stick+, I decided it was worth a go. Installation was extremely easy. I live in a 3000+ sq ft house, and the wireless access point is downstairs on the other side of the house. The Roku stick picked it up immediately and has yet to drop it. After 2 weeks and nearly flawless performance, I pulled the plug on my provider. I don't miss 800+ channels (many redundant) and my nearly $300 monthly bill. The kids one demand was a TV channel that rhymes with 'Rick'. So for the cost of wireless, an Indoor antenna (sold in a green box) for local channels, and minimal subscription costs to 3 streaming services (First letters N, H and P, in case I'm not supposed to mention names), I get everything the family wants and only a wireless bill. I advise providing power to the stick via AC power vs USB. In my case, every time the TV power was turned off, power to the stick was removed, and it had to go through a reboot cycle next time the TV was turned on. Doesn't happen on AC power. Gets a bit hot, but nothing out of the ordinary. And unless I have to change the TV Input source or TV channels to select signals provided by the Indoor Antenna, the Roku remote controls my TV power, volume and allows me to select programs via voice input. For the cost, a GREAT bargain! Goodbye, cable TV.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2019","S. Lamb",317

"Connection problem caused by the advanced wireless receiver","I have several Roku & Fire sticks and all work very good. But I like the Roku little bit more. This one ""Roku Streaming Stick+ | HD/4K/HDR Streaming Device with Long-range Wireless and Voice Remote"" started having problems with connectivity after a week and by the 2nd week I had to restart it many times in order to get connected. Eventually, in the third week there was no connection at all. Called Amazon and they were nice enough to send a second one the next day. After testing the second one, I noticed that the stick and remote is working fine. The only culprit here was the advanced wireless receiver. If you have a connection problem, the most likely reason is the little cord that gets directly attached to the Roku stick.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2020","dostoevsky",318
"Like getting a new TV","I tried to get HULU on my 4 year old Vizio Smart TV. Although Netflix and Amazon Prime worked great (or so I thought) HULU kept starting and stopping while it buffered. A major disappointment since it had content not available on the other two.A little research suggested that the receiver on the Vizio was the problem. I ordered the Roku on the assumption that if it didn't work I could return it.The setup was amazingly simple! Plug it in, attach the cord, follow the on-screen prompts. 10 minutes and I was up and running. When the content was up on the screen I realized what I was missing. I had a 4k monitor but was only streaming 780 because of the receiver. The Roku bypassed this to deliver the full 4k + better sound!! As the title said, it was like getting a brand new TV for only $60! Plus the Roku remote controls the TV and sound bar better than their own remotes. One control to do it all.One minor complaint that is more a note to Roku than a problem. Why no back lit remote? TVs operate in the dark and I would have happily paid an extra dollar for the feature.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2019","braunj",318

After about an hour looking for solutions I fixed it by connecting it to a mobile wifi network (my laptop's). After that I connected it to our regular home wifi and now it works like a charm.

"I brought my rating from 4 to 3","I brought my rating from 4 to 3.My main criticism concerns the remote. It has only very limited functions and there is no performant alternative to be found on Amazon or elsewhere. For $25 Sideclick can add a few functions, but it still is incomplete.The shortcut keys are useless to me since I don't watch the Hulu, Sling and Netflix imposed shortcuts. I do watch Amazon Prime, but there is no shortcut key for that, nor is there any possibility to reprogram the imposed keys. I deplore the inexistence of any user programmable keys altogether, which exist in higher end Roku models. Therefore, the Roku remote cannot take control of the TV sleep function or the image and sound settings. Neither does it allow to mute the sound, if you can believe that. I have no alternative than to juggle with 2 remotes.Technically, the remote doesn't work well. It often becomes unresponsive while the batteries are still good. When this happens, I can wait a minute or two, and if this isn't enough, take the batteries out and back in, turn the TV off, and if this still doesn't work, unplug the stick, reset the router... It happens more and more often - at least once every hour when I zap between channels.Finally, there are buffering problems and frequent sound-image coordination problems, which do not exist on my Roku Ultra.This stick wasn't the great buy I initially thought.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2019","RaulKing",318

I have Spectrum cable service and they charge ~$10/month for each additional cable box that you have in your home. The ROKU is fantastic and I can access my Spectrum channels, Amazon Prime video, Netflix, etc. using the remote. Note that you need a paid subscription to stream these particular apps, but it served the purpose of getting additional TVs in my home functional without having to pay rental fees for additional cable boxes.

"Almost too good to be true.","My brother and I were splitting a cable package for about $150.00 a month and he told me they were raising the price again! I said get rid of it and he did, then I baught this Roku unit not expecting much but it was cheap and had to better than nothing.My old cable was pretty lousy, I could hardly ever find a good movie to watch so I was astounded to see the quantity and quality of the movies available on Roku. I only watch the free channels and there seems to be thousands of great movies from 1937 to the present, more than I could ever watch.I am amazed that expensive cable companies are still in business, if everybody knew how good Roku is they would be out of business in a month.

The home screen is nice, simple, and easy to customize, while the video playback is snappy and responsive. I've been very happy with it and love the device. My only complaint is that Disney plus requires an HDR tv to play 4k content. My 4K tv is not HDR compatible and as a result Disney plus only plays in 1080p. This is a limitation that Disney has set and my FireTV Stick 4K exhibits the same behavior.

It was easy to set up, easy to download all the apps, works beautifully with my Amazon accounts, and the Roku channel just about covers everything I watch! I will save so much money ditching satellite ask together now! Versus the first stick... If say they do the exact same things. Fire stick allows the Roku channel to be downloaded and Roku allows the Amazon video app, so they're basically equal. Both have the ability to ask it to find what you want, and both were equally good at it! I'm glad two great companies carry such great products. That being said, Roku is just a tiny bit easier to add apps, only because it goes through one account (roku) instead of having to order through each seperated company.

"If not for the sound issues I would have kept it","We bought both the Fire TV Stick and this Roku Streaming Stick Plus for two different tvs. The Roku has a nice clean home page, but we couldn't get any further than that because we could not get any audio from our sound bar when using the Roku. And apparently the remote will not work to control the volume with a soundbar (which we didn't know before we ordered it), even IF we could have had audio. It worked with our tv audio, but it does not have the sound quality we liked. So then we tried it on our 2nd tv which uses just the tv audio. It played audio, but through the remote setup, we discovered that the remote was not compatible to control Roku audio. This may be a great option for some if you have the right audio setup, but it didn't work for us.

As I took the batteries out of the old remote, I accidentally touched one of the shortcut buttons. When I put the batteries in the new remote, it's completely dead. I cannot exit out of the shortcut to Netflix. I had to put the batteries back in the old remote to get rid of it. Ugh!!!I have had a Roku Ultra in the past, but when it started acting up this year, I replaced it with this stick. Less than 3 months it started messing up. Non-responsive, poor wifi (even though I have Excellent wifi, even noted by roku). Very Sluggish going through menus and loading programs. The remote had to have the buttons pressed 2,3,4 times before the selection would change, and that's got nothing to do with the wifi. I have to say that Roku has certainly cut corners on their products. It took nearly 3 weeks to get another remote, they wouldn't replace the stick. I had to buy another Streaming device, Nvidia Shield TV just so I could watch tv. Wifi is fantastic with the Nvidia, so sluggishness at all. Needless to say, because of the New sub-quality of the Roku devices, I will no longer be purchasing any more of them.

It eats batteries like a kid eating candy on Halloween, and it doesn’t control the Roku a good 1/4 of the time, and doesn’t turn the tv on or off a good 2/3 of the time despite pairing it. Sometimes the Roku device just reboots after turning it on, as well. It’s still far less buggier than the apps on my Samsung TV, so I’m tolerating it, but you might want to start using the Roku remote app on your cellphone, which sadly seems to work better.

"Great portal for paid content, awful for so-called ""free"" stuff","As a Prime and YouTube member, paid content is seemless and high quality. Both video and audio quality is top notch...and the remote works well. But those looking for free content should look elsewhere. Commercials in the free section are relentless, though the system will notify you on the top left of the screen how long you'll need to wait.... ""1/7"" or something similar, for example, meaning it's the first of seven ads. If they left you alone after the 7 ads for extended programming that's be great. But they don't. The content is generally abbreviated, shortened versions of the familiar format, followed once again by an onslaught of commercials. Roku is a big fail, nothing like it used to be, unless you simply like the easy connection to paid programming (they'll require a credit card) or programming you've already paid for like Prime.

That said it has Amazon Prime and Spectrum capability and works about like every other Roku device I have.The reason for degrading a star is that it runs way too hot (too hot to touch and shudder to think about internal temps) so I added a gaggle of 1/2"" square heat sinks using thermally conductive grease and also placed a very small box fan behind the TV to blow on the Roku.

And the audio for Paramount was always out of sync, even after reinstalling. Other services worked fine. I know that's not Roku's fault, but they should be working with Paramount to fix these issues. Despite that, I would have kept it if not for the terrible remote. First, there's no back-lighting, so you can't see the buttons in a dark room. But worse than that, it cannot control my AVR receiver volume (only supports volume control of TVs), so I need 2 remotes to use Roku. I'll stick to my free Xfinity Flex. It doesn't support 4K for Paramount, which I now know is no big loss, but the other apps are in 4K, and it controls my receiver, and it lights up in the dark. Even Paramount is better on the Flex. It's not in 4K, but at least the audio is in sync!","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2021","Dennis",321
"Love ROku","Love ROKU. I already bought a total of 4. is very easy to use and to move around the different streaming apps and channels. I like that you don't get bombarded with adds like with the Amazon stick.Don't like that in the ROKU app, you cant organize your channels so all ROKUS have the same line up in all the TV's. This must be done manually on each ROKU; of course, i had to write them all down in order to remember.Overall, You can get so much for such little price that is totally worth buying it.I haver not been able to get it to work with Alexa but that just me.

"Love ROKU","If you are new to these types of devices and are trying to decide between Roku and FireTV, just stop right there and get a Roku. The Roku just works all the time without any hassle. Every major streaming service is available and Roku makes it easy to sign in and watch. It connects to wifi just fine and works on every TV I have. I have several Fire's too because they are cheap, and I thought I could make the switch because I am invested into a lot of Prime stuff. The Fire's always give me grief with needing to reboot all the time, disconnects from wifi, Netflix locks up in between episodes, and other problems. Save yourself the aggravation and just get a ROKU.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2021","JimJinny",322
"finally cut the cord","These are replacing my mom's DirecTV service. Super easy to install, only the power cord to the TV shows, no other nasty wires. No dust magnet genie or satellite boxes. Setting up the channels you want to add is amazingly easy & can set up control to curb inadvertent movie purchases.The only negative I can find is Roku uses a LOT of bandwidth. I have xfinity plan with 1Tb of data and that is used up by the 20th of the month - mom is elderly & watches a LOT of TV. Had to upgrade internet to unlimited data, but even so it is still less expensive than the DirecTV plan.So weigh your options, do research.

"Great streaming stick!!!","Like all products on Amazon, reviews are all over the place on this Roku streaming stick. Some say it was hard to set up, some say they got a faulty unit. I had no issues at all. I opened the box, plugged it in to a HDMI port and connected the power to a USB port. I guess some USB ports don't supply enough power to run a Roku but the Roku will tell you if it has the power to work and my Samsung tv was able to do this. Set up was very simple, just follow the on screen directions. Someone also said the remote would not control a sound bar so I was ready to use a separate remote to control the volume. The remote connected automatically to my TV AND sound bar! My sound bar is an older model and is plugged into the optical audio out. When I hit the Roku's power button the TV comes on and so does the sound bar. Volume is also supported! Our TV is a pre 2016 75 inch Samsung smart TV with a lot of apps like Netflix but didn't support YouTube TV which we are going to use after we dump DirectTV which is costing in the $150 range now. It's available on the Roku. I upgraded our router at the same time as ours was getting a little long in the tooth. Bottom line is Roku is easy to set up, simple to navigate and has lots of great features, some of which aren't even listed in the description. On the fence? Buy it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2019","Scott H.",322
"May not work with old TVs; requires credit card registration","If what you need is a wi-fi boost, this Roku may be for you. It was able to work in a room that had very weak wi-fi. But when I tried to use it on an old TV, that TV did not have the proper HDCP 2.2 port. There is a work-around if you do not need 4K but I could not figure it out. And there was another glitch. This Roku requires that you set it up with a credit card, which I did not wish to do as I do not intend to purchase content. Our other Rokus do not/did not have this requirement. There is a youtube video that gives a work-around, but I did not try it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2021","Louisa Filomarino Cauvin",322

It surprised me how well it worked and how convenient it is. The number of free viewing options is unbelievable and the way it manages both free and paid streaming services was simply incredible. I feel a sorry for the satellite services. Every time I show this solution to a friend they too cancel their satellite service, get a streaming service at less than half the cost, and use the first month's saving to buy a Roku to manage it all.

"Need to upgrade sound issues.","Sound is out of sync. Sometimes it seems to be off by a half second or so.A common issue is when an ad starts, the sound becomes extremely loud. (Thought there was a federal statute requiring that sound should remain the same.) When I verbally request music the unit automatically wants to load Pandora. I ask for Prime Music and Roku always loads Pandora. I removed pandora because I have subscriptions to I Heart and Prime. It will actually reload Pandora. Actually my old Roku III hat Amazon as a control button but it was removed and replaced on my Ultra controller. Same issues on my Streaming Stick +es. (Have 2) How about putting Prime back on and maybe putting YouTube TV instead of Sling. YouTube TV is better by the way. Next DirectTV will be buying their way onto Roku’s controller. Last item.

"Replaced older stick that bought the farm...","Install went smoothly. There is/was no activation fee as clearly stated in manual. They wanted a credit card but clearly install was not chargeable and there were no hidden fees. There is nothing nefarious in requesting a card if it's for their own protection. You still have to pay for for subscriptions such as Amazon Prime and Netflix which are separate from the purchase price of this hardware. I had no connection problems with this stick. I still see some buffering issues but I'm not sure how much is due to my provider or the hardware. Either way it's been minimal and far better than my original stick which was one of the first ones made by the company. I'm satisfied. If I had any wants on the controls it would be for them to be backlit and maybe the mute button placement. I don't know what that would do to battery life or costing.

"Pairing the remote is an issue.","I have 3 Roku 3800s in my house, and they work great. I needed another unit so I decided to get the 3810 since it was on sale.

I will be returning this item for a replacement. I will update this review if the replacement works as expected. In the meantime buyer beware.Edit: After spending some time with Roku's Customer Service via Instant Messenger, it was determined that it was my fault I could not pair my remote. Due to the extremely short cables that are provided with this product, I substituted their USB mini cable with one that I had on hand. Unfortunately, theirs contains a device ""in line"" which is necessary to operate the Roku, and I unsuspectedly removed it (I thought it was some sort of surge protector for the Roku stick).

"Remote Drains Batteries when USB powered","I've had many Rokus for a good number of years, but needed 2 of them to put behind tvs without having a cable hanging down. This is why we I purchased 2 sticks.Plugging this device into the USB on the back of a TV (or any powersource that isn't always on like a switched outlet) causes the batteries in the remote to run dry in less than a week (without even being used!)While this is an engineering flaw that could probably be sorted out with a firmware update, my low review comes from Roku choosing to ignore this issue for years, and continuing to give its customers the runaround. They haven't owned the issue or worked on a fix...instead just directing customers to simply plug the USB into a power outlet instead of their TV.If you're planning on plugging this device into the USB power on the back of your TV, and aren't 100% that your USB stays powered when your TV is off...then best to find a different solution than this.Roku wants this device to always be on...that way it can monitor your entire network and sell the information advertisers...so don't expect a fix for this!","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2021","msreview",324

I had written to Vizio without any response. Finally after some searching in the internet for solutions, it came back with a cheap solution for a dongle. I picked this one because with the Chromecast you had to use your phone to stream it. This Roku comes with a remote that works for your tv and even has voice search. It installed over 130 channels with more to select from. I have tried Netflix and Hulu and HBOGO and it plays every movie I select with no problems. I am so satisfied with this.

"Overall I'm pleased but there is a problem with the remote eating up the battery charge","These are my first Rokus, bought two at once, and overall, I’m pleased with the outcome, but there is a problem with the remotes eating up the battery charge.Installation: 2 large TVs up close against the wall. Power outlets right behind, no wires hanging down. For both TVs, just not enough room back there to connect the stick directly to the power outlets, therefore had to connect the power to the TV’s USB port. As noted in other reviews, not optimal but I really don’t notice it. The Roku Stick goes to an HDMI port, and for the older of my TVs, this port is at the back middle of the TV, not off more to the side. When plugging the Roku stick into this HDMI port, it is sticking out perpendicular to the wall, and sticking out too far for the TV to be put back close to the wall. (The Roku stick is a few inches long.) Problem solved with UGREEN HDMI Extension Cable 4K HDMI Extender Male to Female Compatible for . . . Roku TV Stick, 1.5 ft., at Amazon of course. So, the Roku Stick hangs from an extension behind the TV, not a problem.Setup and activation: Entered a couple of items, went so fast and smooth I can’t remember much about it anymore. Wireless reception excellent but I wasn’t expecting problems here. Watching mostly the local PBS station’s “Passport”, Netflix, Amazon Prime.Remote: Reason for only 3 out of 5 stars. It’s easy to use and controls the TV power and volume without a second remote needed. However, as also mentioned in a previous review, there’s an issue with the remotes eating up the charge of the batteries. After only about 5 weeks, the first remote needed a battery change. The second remote needed a battery change after 7 weeks, and these were Duracell batteries.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2020","Cary K.",325

"Terrible, awful customer experience - find a different streaming supplier!","I bought a $50 Streaming Stick+, and was excited to connect and begin using it. The Stick turned out to be too long to connect to our TV without an HDMI extender (a little device to connect the Stick in these situations). Roku doesn't include an extender in the package, but promises to send a free one to customers who need it (it probably costs Roku about $1 plus shipping). I went to Roku's website to request one, and got this message: ""Your request for an HDMI Extender has been placed on backorder and is expected to ship 2114 -12-31"" - i.e., in 94 years. I wrote customer support and received this message back: ""Unfortunately, the HDMI extender is out of stock for now. We do not have enough resources to look into the information to ship the HDMI extender. ... Your request has been marked as resolved. ... Have a great day!"" Roku could have included the HDMI adapter in its package since many customers obviously need. It could have charged a dollar or two more for that. Instead, it's made me, and I'm sure many other customers, spend hours trying to get the device, only to be told to wait 94 years -- and so permanently alienated customers, and provoked this review. And BTW - once you solve the connection problem, try ""activating"" the Stick - that was a 2- hour process with Roku that repeatedly failed.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2020","John Nimmons",326

"Fantastic for outdoor tv!!!","I put a tv on our patio and was worried about running cable through the walls (brick). Such a fuss! I read on all the different streaming devices and chose the Roku because it has an Xfinity app which is our cable provider. We can now sit on the patio and watch all of our channels and no wires through the wall! Also, the Roku just plugs into the USB on the tv! No need for a power supply but I’m glad it came with one and you didn’t have to pay extra for it! I plan on getting another for our projector to have movie night in the back yard!I had trouble at first getting a solid connection to the internet. Signal would drop and movies would pause to buffer. I decided to upgrade my router. Wow! Big difference! It wasn’t the Roku at all! The Nighthawk router cured that. Will also do my review on the Nighthawk too!The stream stick is larger than most but I had no problem using a different HDMI port. However, if you do have problems with plugging it up, they will send you an HDMI cable for free. So, either way, you’re covered.About the apps- yes, I bought the Roku because it has an app from my cable provider. Yet, that doesn’t mean that you can’t use it if you’re not with Xfinity. There are plenty other cable tv apps available! Additionally, you can simply load the channel app that you want. I also enjoy the free tv apps like Pluto TV. Older movies but good ones and plenty to choose from!A built in web browser would make this unit complete! Still won’t prevent a 5 star rating, though. I have used old desktops for years to connect to projectors and TV’s in my home and shop. The space savings is incredible - going from a desktop to a device the size of a USB jump drive!!

"Get’s too hot","I just installed my new roku and within thirty minutes had a message pop up on my screen saying that my roku was overheating. It was hot to the touch and after some research it is a common problem especially if your device is inside a cabinet which mine is but I have had an amazon fire stick in the exact same spot for a couple of years without a problem. Roku does offer an extender for free that you have to order online. Not sure why they don’t just put it in the box in the first place. The extender will only move it off the back of my home theater system a couple of inches so that probably will not help since it will still be in the cabinet. They’re only true fix for the problem is to move it to a cooler spot which is not an option for me so I’ll have to try something else.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2020","Teresa Woods",327

"Nice little gadget","My husband has been using a Roku streaming stick for several years, while I've been using an older, early version Amazon Fire Stick. Awhile back, I decided to try the Roku -- and he gave me one as a Christmas gift.While I've definitely enjoyed using my new Roku, my biggest complaint (and why I couldn't give it 5 stars) is the location of the off/on sound button. As I'm right-handed, I tend to hold the control in my right hand, switching channels with my right index finger. Since the sound controls are located on the outside of the unit on the right side, I find I'm constantly turning off the sound because my hand is inadvertently squeezing the button.Can you say ... annoying?Other than than, I'm enjoying the opportunity to expand my TV viewing ... and trying to use my left hand to control my new streaming stick.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2020","N.

There is nothing better than sticking it to my cable provider, they suck eggs. I use Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video and others. The High Definition is clear and fast.

"Awesome portable streaming device, but needs HDMI adapter/extender that works","Overall, Im happy with this product. The one gripe I have is that Roku doesnt include an HDMI adapter for these streaming sticks. The Roku stick is long and most newer TVs have this concaved back where the HDMI inputs are. So this Roku stick will not plug in and fit properly. You need an HDMI adapter/extender. The manual states that you can order it for free and it arrives within a few days. But why is it NOT INCLUDED to begin with? Also, the part that they provided does not even work. I dont know if it fails to convert HDCP 2.2 through the extender, but the Roku stick would not get detected by my TV as an HDMI source. I created my own extender using a regular HDMI cable and attached an HDMI coupler to it, and that worked well. This is the reason why I gave it 4 stars. If Roku addresses this, it would have been 5 stars easily.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2021","L. America",327
"Doesn’t work with Yamaha AVR and projector","This service doesn’t do well with the AVR setup. Most of the time it causes the AVR to lose the connection type and retry. Therefore, I get audio for 5 seconds and no picture before it tries to reconnect and do the same thing again. It is unusable most of the time. When I did get it to work, some apps work great, but not DIRECTV Stream.

"Quick, great picture, but streams with TV off","I bought this stick to replace a several year old Roku stick that had a laggy interface since year 1. This is almost the perfect stick. Very snappy and I swear my 1080P image is much sharper with this stick. Whereas my old stick was powered by the TV USB, this stick requires more power than my TV USB offers... so have to use the plug-into-socket option. The only downside is the ROKU stick is always on, which is not bad, except when I'm streaming live You Tube TV and forget to hit <HOME> <Power off> and just hit <Power Off> (which just turns off the TV). A day later if I've not watched this TV I'll find this stick has been streaming continuously: Bandwidth Hog.

On the other hand I have watched the amount of content on these shrink immensely. They just keep adding more channels that's content is hidden behind paywalls and getting rid of apps. It was pretty cool when at first I found out that if you wanted things still like twitch and other apps that are not supported you could use unofficial apps through a code to watch the content. As of 2 days ago they have closed all unofficial content off and offered no alternatives. These will be getting replaced soon.

I was dubious at first because while checking for other reviews on internet, I read articles where the reviewer didn't seem to notice any improvement in Wifi reception of their test unit.Set up was pretty straight forward. You will have to set up Roku account if this is your first Roku. I found Roku remote superior to Amazon's Firestick remote because it also double as TV remote.Of course, you don't need Streaming Stick+ version if you have no lag issues on Wifi reception.Update: I still have some lag issues but compared to my old Amazon stick lag is shorter duration and recovery is quick once I get out and get back in.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2018","A.

Had some issues with wifi on my smart TV that I bought for cheap (it's an LG, but I guess you get what you pay for if you're going cheap) so the Roku was a much cheaper alternative to fixing it or buying a new TV. The remote is simple and works great, I wish it was lighted so I can operate it in the dark (I use this in my bedroom) and the interface, though not great, is very functional. The voice search is a nice feature but the integration with Alexa is not simple enough and we ended up not using it that much. Wifi reception and streaming quality is very good, although I tried to check my internet connection via Roku the other day and it said the connection was slow, but I was able to stream HD content with no issues.

This stick very much improves the resolution on the set, above what the TV is capable of! I was blown away by it. I downloaded the xfinity app as I have their service, but the voice remote is useless to call up channels with it using the xfinity app. It works fine on the roku app, but nothing else to date I have tried will work using the voice control on the remote. I can turn tv on by pressing just about any button BUT the power button on the remote, but the power button will shut it off just fine. I don't know why the power button won't do both. These are the reasons for the loss of a star on versatility.

I was expecting to get the remote shown in the picture with Netflix, SlingTV, Directv and Hulu buttons but, instead of a Hulu button, I got an ESPN button (ew, yuck!)

"Audio doesn’t sync with video. Always having to re-boot it.","I bought 2 different Roku devices for my family when we discontinued our cable. This one, for about $50 which we use in our family room, and the “express” version for $25.00 for the bedroom. The less expensive one in the bedroom work fine, no problems. THIS version however doesn’t. The audio doesn’t line up with the video, so you’ve got a news reporter movining their lips, with their words lagging a couple sentences behind. The only way to “fix” it is to turn off the tv, then unplug the Roku for a few minutes.So, if im really trying to listen to something that I’m interested in, I either have to deal with looking at the video without the audio lining up, OR stop everything for abou 5 minutes to reboot. This started happening about a week ago and I know the problem is with this unit, because my son streams the same channels in his room, and I stream the same channels in my room, using different streaming devices with no issues.I hope it’s not too late to return this.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2019","Terye A.",333

"Hate reboot Roku if NOT used when TV is turned on instantly.","I seem to have to reset the remote control almost every time I use it. Plugged directly into the TV. When I turn the TV in it is instantly there. However when I push ANY button including home, it does nothing. I have to push the reset on the Roku unit EVERY TIME, then wait for it to reboot. Then it works fine. I do watch 4K Blu-ray’s and then switch back to Roku. Even then I still have to reboot the Roku. Other than single pain in the neck I’m pretty happy with the unit. If I could get the reboot every time to stop I would rate it higher. Great looking picture.

"Froze up playing HD video","I got this to use it as a client for a Jellyfin media server (jellyfin.org), as there was an official client for Roku and this looked like a good option to do 4K without being too expensive. However, when connected to a 5Ghz WiFi network (within 5 feet of the router), it struggled to smoothly play even 1080p Blu-ray rips. I know this was not an issue with the network connection, the server is connected to the router with gigabit ethernet and the router is a high-end Netgear model with WiFi 6 support, and besides, the files it struggled with were only 15Mb/sec. This Roku could not play a movie that a laptop from 2007 had no trouble playing. Overall, I was very disappointed with this device, and I ended up returning it and got an old Chromebox (for less than I paid for this Roku) and installed Windows 10 and the Jellyfin desktop client, and it works great.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2021","Frog4096",333

"After 6 months the remote died","The ""Point Anywhere Remote"" is probably the worst remote I've ever had. From day one it was a problem getting it to pair and work. It would work fine and then suddenly you would have to get the remote within about 10 inches of the roku stick to get it to start working again. Then you could walk away. Now it wont work at all when you walk away. The effective range of the remote with fresh batteries, and a full factory reset is about 6 inches if you're lucky. It will not work at all beyond 6 inches. Have ordered the free hdmi extender that they offer, and we'll see if that works.

"HDMI into my Marantz NR1508","Plugged into HDMI input to my Samsung TV first, worked great. I'm only watching free shows, and signed up without a credit card on the Roku site. But it was a hassle to switch to the HDMI input to the TV, since I usually use my Marantz to watch DVD/Blu-Ray and my DVR for free Over-The-Air shows from my antenna. So I unplugged the HDMI from the TV, and plugged it into the HDMI input for Cable in the back of the Marantz. It has been working perfectly for several days now, and my remote lets me switch between them all. My only regret is losing the DVR functionality I have with my OTA reception - setting up recordings in advance, pause/play/skip capability, and having copies of things I recorded while I was doing other things.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2020","TonyD",334

"Great Product with Shortcomings","Stick has been working great for a while, but recent updates have some apps suddenly rebooting and sometimes requires rebooting the stick. Not sure if these issues are specific to the apps or the stick.Overall a great buy for cord cutters - you can access things like Amazon video, which aren't accessible through Chromecast. Biggest drawbacks are the dated interface and inability to sync app authorizations across multiple Roku devices, the latter scenario requires you to authorize each app on each Roku device.One recommendation for Roku and other buyers - if you're putting this in a rear HDMI port on a wall mounted TV you'll need to purchase a separate, flexible HDMI extension so the stick can hang down flat against the wall.Update @ 1 Year:We've had a lot of issues with the audio going out of sync and the video automatically zooming in making shows unwatchable. Seems to only happen on the Hulu app, but that is one we use heavily in our household. I imagine that's a software issue, but I have to put it on Roku to get it fixed.Never had these problems with our other two, older Rokus.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2017","Brent Kepler",334

"Sound Quality so Great it almost Cost me my Relationship","I bought the Roku Streaming Stick because my smart TV is 7 years old and the built in apps are becoming obsolete. Roku has extended my ""old"" smart TV's lifespan by allowing access to more up to date versions of streaming apps I use everyday... for the mere cost of $29.99. The sound quality of the Roku Stick is phenomenal! I can attest to this because I was on the phone with my girlfriend when I first hooked up the stick. Little did I know that I would be greeted by an intro video featuring a very well spoken female voice actress. Her voice was so clear that my girlfriend asked me who was at my apartment while we were on the phone! After I explained I had just installed the Roku Stick and she was hearing the intro video actress, we both had a good laugh and moved on with our lives. The Roku Stick streams well, has great sound quality, and almost cost me my relationship. 5 out of 5 would re-live that moment again.

I use this now and have the USB powered by the 3.0 hub the TV has. I like that it turns on the TV so no need for the original remote. We have noticed (this is very seldom) that a message will appear in the top right corner and say the Roku is overheating. This message might stay for less than 5 minutes and go away. The Roku has never shutdown from it though. Not sure why it does that as the stick has adequate ventilation behind it.

"Give the USB a second to turn on..","This is now my 3rd roku, of all different generations. In short they all work very well and I'm a big fan of the new stick approach. One thing to note is that the product gives the option for a USB or outlet powered use. As the instructions indicate, a red light will illuminate and a notification will present on the screen if the USB does not have enough power. However, I find this is also potentially a temporary problem as the TV starts up and starts feeding power to the device. After about a minute or so, this message disappears and the device works as normal. While your results may vary, if you are pressed to find an outlet and have a a little older Samsung lcd TV, in my experience it's only a minute or so, tops, before the TV is able to power the device. That said, it may function a bit better with even more power via an outlet, however I have had no issues yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2018","randumtasx",335

It would simply lock up. So, I purchased this Roku stick figuring I just had one which was not functioning well. Well, the Roku stick fails to play UHD from VUDU and defaults to the HDX version. When I use the VUDU function on my TV I never have a problem with the UHD playback.Also, the remote this comes with requires re-connecting, also about, every two days. It will not keep a constant connection. You have to reboot the stick and then reestablish the remote connection every other day. I kept with Roku as the other devices do not seem to include VUDU which is where my movie library is located. I gave it a one star as when it works, it is fine, it just has tantrums every other day as well as no UHD.

This stick is too long to fit, thus, an HDMI extender was needed for me to use this stick.The $10 cheaper, Amazon Fire 4K stick comes with an HDMI extender. So, I just assumed since this is its competitor device, that this would include one also. It didn't.

It's been working almost issue free (a few hard restarts here and there). I've updated my rating to 3 stars (from 1 star) just for Roku's horrible customer service and I feel longevity is still unclear.I wouldn't buy it again unless it's $15 or less and wouldn't recommend buying it for its current price.Original review 8/2019:This is my 5th Roku. I also have 2 fire sticks but Roku always seems faster and the UI is more intuitive.The Roku Streaming Stick+ is my favorite so far (when it comes to responsiveness) and it was working flawlessly for over 2 months before I started having remote connection issues and a few days later wifi connectivity issues.Roku customer service is horrendous.I've spent over an hour (after 30 minutes wait) chatting with CS representative. He kept saying to call my ISP to resolve the wifi issues even though it was working flawlessly before and that this is the only device in my house that has connection issues. It took him forever to respond and he kept asking the same questions basically ignoring my answers.Only after I told him this chat was going nowhere he offered a replacement.I had to pay to ship it back to Roku. I received the replacement 14 days after they received the defective one, no communication from them whatsoever.Calling them is just a waste of time. No matter what options you make, you never get to speak with anyone and it will end in an abrupt hang up.I wouldn't get again or recommend getting any Roku with a ""point anywhere"" remote. I have 5 Roku devices, 2 of them with ""point anywhere"" remote and both remotes stopped working.Roku really do make great media devices and I was always happy with their products but if you do have a problem, you will need to deal with their very unhelpful customer service or simply trash your Roku if warranty has expired.Also 90 day warranty is not enough.I can't give a 5-star rating to a product that is not 100% backed by its manufacturer.I think it's just a matter of time before the replacement will break too.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2019","Tal A.",337

Even more frustrating, often once on the first time, it becomes difficult to shut down. It often takes 3 or 4 minutes to turn it on and secure access to Hulu.

I always need to connect to Wifi manually and netflix gets disconnected multiple times making TV watching a bad experience.

"UPDATE 3/29/20 Nothing but Problems","I bought this unit 10/10/18 and it worked fine until around 7/10/19 (9 months) then had chronic problems as follows: the remote would not communicate with the Roku stick and when it did it was so slow you never knew when it would respond. I contacted Roku CS on 7/13/19 and they said they would replace it with another unit after I return my bad unit first. It took more than a week to receive another one which after several months had similar problems as the first unit. In November of 2019 I bought an Amazon Fire-stick on sale for around $15, The Roku cost was $60 when purchased. I kept the Roku by mistake and today (3/19/20) decided to try it again just in case it might work again ""Hope over experience"" but it doesn't. My Fire-stick works great but there were some apps that were on the Roku I liked that are not available on the Fire-stick albeit not really important. I would not recommend this Roku to anyone who would be considering it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2018","Hillbilly Bob",338
"Has one of the best/largest selections of apps to use with it","I like Roku because it can be used with more of my favorite apps than most others like it. It does not cost anything to connect & use as long as you go to the Roku site not a fraudulent site; just make sure that you get your web address correct & write just exactly what the Roku app tells you to. It has a lot of apps to use with it; most are free. My only complaint is that most of the free apps show so many commercials so often that it makes it very difficult to watch a show. Also, most free apps show lower quality shows; part of the problem is some of the free apps allow just anyone (professional or not) to make movies & etc & post on the free apps so stay with top rated apps. It offers a great selection of shows & apps so it is well worth the money.

I guess it was deep in REM sleep. Finally after about 1 minute of this nonsense it did start to work again.

"Easy to setup, easy to use","When Comcast raised their prices again for cable tv service, I questioned my sanity for having paid for dozens and dozens of channels I never watch. I mean seriously, if we watch more than three different channels in a week, someone must be sitting on the remote. So I cut the proverbial cord and went with Hulu, accessible thru this Roku streaming stick. Hulu wasn't a good fit and I dropped them in favor of DirecTVNow which doesn't buffer content every five minutes like Hulu, so we're all the way to Happy now.Setup on the Roku could not have been easier. Well, that's not true. Punching in my Netflix and Amazon sign-ins is painfully slow, but should be a one time thing. Setting up Hulu was just about as easy. Roku includes an adapter so that you can plug it into a USB port on the back of the TV, so why Amazon pushes a similar device seems silly.Watching stored content on the Roku is fine - fast, clear, and no delays. They have tons of optional and mostly free channels, including Pluto, which has reruns of Mystery Science Theater 3000.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2018","Marty B",339

"Connection range is limited","have been using Roku products for about 6 years and have been very pleased so far. I have an A/V receiver in another room that controls my tv and surround sound so I plugged the stick directly into the receiver. Everything works great, until you let it sit for a few hours and it goes into some kind of power saving mode. The remote will no longer connect to the stick without walking into the other room and pressing a button so it will reconnect. I tried every setting I could find and had no luck. The range on the remote is amazing once it is connected, but it was very annoying to lose signal constantly. I am returning this product and have a Roku Ultra hooked up to my receiver right now...which is working just fine. I am a big fan of the hard-wired connection available for the Ultra and the ability for the device to accept a usb stick to stream media. The other really nice thing is that I can control my tv power and the volume of my receiver (which, remember is in another room) all with the Roku remote. I know that I have a unique situation, but Roku still had a device that works for me. I do wish that they would note the range of the remote to the stick when pairing.

When the company updates the software on the device, it wipes out all my settings, and I have to set it up again as if I were installing it for the first time. I hate it when I turn on the TV to watch a movie and discover I have to go through the 20-minute process of reconnecting the remote, registering the Roku device online, picking my settings again, and then logging back in to my channels.

"this is our favorite. It's very affordable","Of the various streaming devices that we have, this is our favorite. It's very affordable, it's small, it was easy to physically hook up, and easy to set up and use. It's got an extensive list of popular apps, as well as some apps we've never heard of that we plan to experiment with. Aside from the great variety of apps, what makes it a favorite for us is the remote. It fits very comfortably in the hand, the buttons have a solid tactile feel, and the button functions are sensible. There's a volume control for the TV that's very convenient, but unfortunately it doesn't have a mute button. The primary reason we didn't rate this Roku device 5 stars, however, has to do with the prolonged difficulty that we had to get the advertised $50 Sling credit from our new Roku account for a new Sling account. Roku and Sling repeatedly pointed responsibility to each other. After a week of attempting to get the credit and spending over 8 hours on the phone with both Roku and Sling, Roku ultimately rejected our claim for the credit even though we are new subscribers to both! I subsequently requested a return authorization from Amazon. After a short cooling off period, however, we decided not to give up and I'm happy to say we figured it out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2018","Marcela",340

If you have any 4K setup and you need a streaming stick this one fits the bill. Set-up is a cakewalk with the Roku interface walking you through your options. We've owned the standard streaming sticks but this one comes with a remote that lets you control your tv's volume (only works with the TV's volume not a separate soundbar which we have) It would be nice if they allowed control of other sound devices. The remote also has a voice search feature that i found myself using more and more to search for movies or shows i want to watch instead of scrolling through an endless list of media.

"Worked about 6 weeks then died, went through 2 Roku's and 2 remotes all dead","Worked wonderfully for about 6 weeks. Then nothing but problems. Went and got a second Roku, that one was better and lasted a little longer but then the remote stopped working. Had to buy a new remote. That new remote worked for about 2 months then stopped working again. Terrible unresponsive customer service and unable to RMA for replacement. Waste of money.The device started to not stay powered on. The screen will flicker off, and after about 10 seconds turn back on again, then 10 seconds later will turn off. The only way to fix this right now seems to be that I need to unplug it from the back of my receiver and power it off completely for about a minute to reset it before it starts working again for about a day.This doesn't give me much faith in the QC.

"Best performance and value.","I switched from Direct TV to You Tube TV. I purchased 4 Roku Streaming Stick Plus sticks, one for each TV. I decided on these over other streaming sticks because they were the most affordable and had the highest ratings.I am super impressed on how easy they were to set up and use. They have great WiFi speed with no buffering. My Samsung smart tv’s often buffer especially while watching 4K programs, but not these Roku’s. They offer great performance and value.

I’m glad I can have a lineup of favourite channels in order to avoid those I don’t care about. I’m also very pleased to be able to watch international tv channels through YouTube.

I have a separate Roku smart tv that is older and uses a remote that is almost identical but does not have voice recognition and I have only had to change the batteries once. This Roku stick remote has gone through at least a dozen batteries in around a year, so I assume it has something to do with the voice recognition.

Evidently, this is a problem for a LOT of users. There are some apps where this is not - or barely - noticeable, but Amazon Prime is terrible. The audio is at least a half second behind the video, sometimes more. Resetting the Roku hasn't helped.

This thing constantly crashes, constantly resets, has great difficulty changing the cursor and menus (freezes), and apps like Netflix and Sling commonly will not start and an error message appears to ""please force close the app and wait 1 minute.""

"Awesome device!","Great purchase! I’m thoroughly enjoying using my Roku. No connectivity issues and it was simple to install. Primarily I use it for my Xfinity cable box solution. After speaking with an Xfinity rep she mentioned that I wouldn’t be responsible for renting the 2 extra cable boxes I was going to pay $10 more each for. That’s $20 plus tax monthly. Now I can watch all my cable stations on the Xfinity app plus this is portable. After downloading the Xfinity App on my Roku I also did the same on my iPhone. Anyway the 2 Roku’s will pay for themselves in a few months. Much easier to use than my Firestick. Loving the 1 click Hulu and Netflix buttons.

"Loving It","This has been super easy to use so far. Really simple plug and play, I even used the USB port on the back of my TV to power it and haven't had any issues yet (Samsung nu6900, if you're wondering). It detected 4k HDCP and hasn't given me any problems yet, but I've had it less than a day so I'll update if I come across any issues.The remote has a nice sturdy feel when you ""click"" the buttons, but I haven't used the voice option yet (and probably won't, tbh). I'm amazed at all the free content. My main reason for getting this was for HD streaming, but also because there's a Wow Presents Plus app. I was using my Chromecast to access that before, but the Chromecast is so moody and relies on my phone. It was always losing the wifi connection too. The Roku has a 2G and 5G wifi, which is exactly what my Spectrum router offers.

However, with that said, it does have some limitations. Using the Roku voice remote you can search for Roku apps, but you can't search for channels within the app. Example. in the Xfinity app, you say ""History Channel"" into the remote, and Roku pulls up the History Vault app for Roku, not the History Channel. Otherwise, no complaints. And I'm saving $120/year on rental.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2019","Yogi Bear",345
"New to Roku and very happy","I’m new to Roku and it’s been great. I’ve always had Apple TVs but having change to YouTube TV away from traditional cable I opted to buy this Roku streaming stick plus as it was compatible with YouTube TV. I also use quite often prime video, Netflix, HBO now, UFC fight pass, Amazon music and YouTube, all of which are easy to navigate to from the home screen. I do wish I could customize which of the short-cut buttons were on my remote as I will never use any of them other than Netflix and perhaps Hulu. Also I wish there wasn’t an advertisement on the right side of the homepage, but it’s really not so invasive. Ultimately this is cheaper, more compatible with the things that I use, and just as effective as any other device I’ve had, so I am happy. The one thing I miss is “mirroring” whatever is on my phone screen to my Apple TV. But this has been very simple to use, I think I’m going to set my parents up with Roku and YouTube TV.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2018","Riley B",345

"Great streaming player at a good price","I've had the Roku Streaming Stick+ for about a week now and I am very impressed with it. I have used a Sony Blu-Ray player with streaming capabilities for about thee years, but it has quirks and the software is rarely updated. It's usability had become so poor that I began checking into other players such as Roku. I almost bought the same model at Costco but decided to see if Amazon's prices was better - which it was, to the tune of $10, and with Prime I got it delivered the next day.Installation was quick and easy, as was setup. There are literally hundreds of additional streaming channels, both pay and free, to download in addition to those pre-installed on the device. Since I bought it, we have used it every day almost to the exclusion of my cable subscription and our DVD/Blu-Ray library. It's not only the selection of material, but also the quality of the picture (I'm running 1080p on a 60"" plasma TV) and audio. There's never any pause for buffering like the Sony player would do on the same internet connection, no skips or dropped frames. The controls are simple and easy to use, even for my wife who's often hopeless with technology. I'm very pleased with my Roku and can't wait to upgrade to a 4k TV so I can take advantage of the device's capabilities at that resolution. I would buy it again and recommend it to anyone who wants a quality streaming device.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2017","T. McBride",346

I could not find the real ROKU . com in all this maize. I therefore gave up on google on my PC and went to another search engine Apple, success, but at a price. Simply put, I would do it their way, via computer interaction. You know the routine, check the correct box, etc.. Never are you allowed to talk to someone on the telephone, text yes, talk no. I could have progressed through many telephone conversations in the time I spent texting with ROKU. Meanwhile ROKU advertises that it does not charge for installation. Unfortunately, Amazon Prime was and yet remains the most difficult application through ROKU, The directions for PRIM take you to Amazon, period. No, Prime through ROKU directions, just Amazon and where do you want to go from here.

I don’t know if it’s just me but when I use it I’m constantly turning the volume up or down but mostly muting it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2022","Mary Saylor",348

"Unfortunately, inherently defective products seem to be common with Roku","We have used Roku streaming stick for over a year with our living room TV without a problem. Based on that experience, we decided to purchase another Roku streaming stick for the bedroom TV. This second Roku device worked for a short period of time, but seemed to have difficulty maintaining a connection to the router (even though it was physically closer than the living room device), resulting in slow or interrupted streaming. Now, after the 30 day return warranty just lapsed (44 days to be precise), our bedroom Roku streaming stick is ""stuck"" on the rather annoying ""bouncing"" Roku logo. Seems quite a few other consumers have experienced the same issue with no real ""fix"" available but to buy another streaming stick.

"Awesome streaming device with great remote","I decided to cut the cord. I bought this along with the Apple TV 4K. I have returned to Apple TV. This little thing is a beast. It streams virtually every service available and does it without issue. The interface is simple. The remote on the Roku+ is awesome in that it also controls your TV and volume. So, you now have this one little remote to literally everything if you have cut the cord exclusively. Also, through the app on the phone you can stream pictures, videos, music from your phone (which is frankly the main reason I bought the AppleTV for ease of streaming from my iDevices). I would buy this again without hesitation, and I have done so for the TVs in my other room.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2019","Martinjm",348
"Best Roku Streaming Stick yet!","This iteration of the Roku Streaming Stick is outstanding. It receives our WiFi signal really well even though neither of our two routers is especially nearby. We don't have problems with skips or picture quality. The interface runs very fast and smoothly on the SS+ versus our original version Streaming Stick. Apps start much quicker on the SS+. Probably the best part for us is that the SS+ remote also operates the basic functions of our TV (i.e. power and volume). We had previously had a really basic cable box on this TV, and the remote from the cable company didn't operate the TV and it was more of a hassle than we expected to juggle the two remotes. The Roku Streaming Stick+ was a big ""quality of life"" improvement in that regard. Also, Roku devices are I believe the only streaming devices that carry the Spectrum TV app, which is vitally important for us since we are Spectrum subscribers. All in all, we are extremely happy with the Roku Streaming Stick+.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2018","Becky Jones",348
"Very straight forward and rarely ever looses signal","The added antenna is definitely worth it. I couldn't use the usb plug in the tv because it didn't push enough juice for the antenna so grabbed a space usb adapter for a wall plug. I've had mine for a few years and the only rear issue I've had and it's lately is that it seems to be loosing the volume on occasion. The trick seems to be to unplug it and let it cool off because it's fine afterwards.

Also drains batteries FAST which is surprising considering it has no displays, lights and is not doing anything 99% of time. Support sent a weak response about headphones draining the batteries (??). I have no idea what that means, but I would like the to address this issue which seems to be pretty common.Also annoying, they do not include the flexible HDMI extender with the stick which they really should.

After enough times replacing the batteries and unplugging the Streaming Stick and plugging it back in it just got easier to realize that Roku remotes are garbage. Replacing them has become tiresome. I now use an app on my phone to operate my Roku Streaming Stick, and because the Roku remote turns the TV on and controls the volume I have to do those things with a separate remote. The seller isn't bad, and tried to work with me. I did get stuck paying for the last replacement because it is too much of a hassle to keep multiple remotes straight, but that's not their fault.

The USB port of my tv provided enough power and I did not need to use an extension. Picture quality is excellent and I can watch so many programs that it will take a long time to decide on favorites. Also, since I subscribe to Prime, Britbox and Acorn services already, I can now watch these in the bedroom.

"Controller doesn’t work, device doesn’t work","Complete piece of garbage. I had a roku from ~7 years ago and it works fine, but pretty slow.

It would accept one input then freeze for ~20 seconds or more.Restarted my tv, and was able to enter my password for WiFi. I actually connected, and then it said it needed to install updates. OK, of course.It installs updates and says it needs to restart.

Netflix streaming via wifi is xlnt from about 40 feet away in my case, no dropouts yet, and my wifi speed is minimal. A few free channels are a bonus, but most of those have commercials. The remote is fine but not easy to use in low light -- I wish the buttons were back lit -- or easier to ID via touch. The voice search is clever but takes you to channels you may not be subscribed to, so I end up not using it. Maybe there's a way to limit it to your personal channels, which I would prefer.

I replaced all my Amazon Fire TV devices for performance reasons","At first, I was forced to Roku to support Xfinity Stream, but even after Amazon delivered support for that product on the Fire, I noticed that it performance significantly better on the Roku device. I sent back my Xfinity cable device and kept internet only service and love getting all my channels and services on one device without having to worry about Amazon keeping their competitors off their products.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2021","Prentice J Rodgers",358
"Problems with overheating","I thought it was working wonderful for about an hour after 1st setting it up, then the message overheating came on, I researched it and found that this seems to be a common problem. I unplugged it and let it cool for 15 minutes, plugged it back in and it worked great. (For 20 minutes) then overheated again. Nothing else in, on, or around my tv is hot.

"ROKU - not really functioning","Edit: The first couple months of having the Roku was great. Now however, the remote has quit working. I've changed the battery, tried repairing it to the TV and tried it on a different TV. Nothing works. So I downloaded the roku remote app on my phone which worked for a while. Unfortunately, it has become really hit or miss. Sometimes one or the other remote will work, I'll watch a show and when I try to change the channel or turn the TV off the remote will no longer work. It's very frustrating.I love my new ROKU! I was using a firestick and had problems all the time. I finally decided to try a ROKU, and I'm so glad I did.

"Just what I needed!","I had been puzzled why so few of the newer 4k products (DVD players, TVs, projectors, etc) won't allow you to add new streaming apps--or if they do, it can be very difficult. So, when I discovered this little unit for just under $40, I was very happy. Playback is nice and sharp, and audio quality is also superb. It's also very user friendly--easy to navigate and find what you're looking for, and installation couldn't be easier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2020","Gaziliontimz",358

"Need a streaming solution that just works? Look no further!","Do you want to start streaming an internet TV service like YouTube TV? Then you can't really go wrong with this Roku Streaming Stick+. I use Xbox One, Google Chromecast and Apple TV to stream YouTube TV and have found that the Roku handles it the best, plus gives us additional channel options, including Netflix and Hulu (separate subscription required). The interface is smooth and responsive and I have not had any issues with watching content. I highly recommend this. The other nice thing about this Streaming Stick+ is that it is small enough to slip into a backpack or bag to take along when you travel. Since it plugs into an HDMI slot, most TVs you'll encounter can be used to watch what you want (or what you want to keep your kids entertained while you do something else).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2018","Hauder",359
"Sets up easy and works well but could use numbers on the remote","Not entirely Roku's fault I suppose but my main reason behind purchasing this unit was so I could get and use the Spectrum cable app for my cable subscription. Apparently Spectrum likes the streaming option nowdays. But after using it for a minute, I realized there is no way to direct dial your channels. You have to bring up the guide and scroll through it to get to what you want. I place this one 50-50 on each. The remote could use buttons and Spectrum could have built a numerical keypad of some kind into their app.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2020","Scott Patterson",359
"Don't Wait, Buy the Roku Streaming Stick+","Have been using the Roku Streaming Stick+ for about 2 weeks now and I have to say this by far is the best Roku for our needs. We have two other Roku players in the house. The new Streaming Stick+ is being used in our basement gym and the wireless connection has not given us one bit of trouble even though it is a floor away and on the other side of the house from the router. I love that the remote also controls the tv volume and power. This is a great feature so you only have to deal with one remote. I generally only use the Roku for exercise apps and it is working flawlessly. I would highly recommend the Roku Streaming Stick+. An added benefit is that you could take the stick anywhere, vacation, friends, etc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2017","Lori",360
"Remote KILLS Batteries in 1-2 Weeks","I am on my second Roku Streaming Stick+. I returned the first one to Amazon thinking it was defective for eating batteries. The second one does the exact same thing. I went onto the ROKU BLOG and found many other users were having the same issue. I contacted ROKU customer support and am waiting for them to send me a new remote that is supposed to solve the problem. In the meantime their solution is to use the Smartphone app as a remote or try plugging the ROKU into a wall outlet (both are pretty sub-optimal suggestions). Apparently the USB power option through your TV could be the root cause of their product defect. I am a big fan of ROKU products and have had various ROKU's since their inception. I do not have this issue with my ROKU express which is the product I would recommend buying until ROKU solves this product defect.

I have a regular streaming stick for over a year and that's never happened. I changed HDMI inputs, TV's, Remotes, HDMI extender, power sources, called customer support, everything and nothing helped.

"Great Streaming","We have the Roku Streaming Stick & it’s used on the TV in our living room where the majority of television is watched. I’m glad I paid a little extra for the protection plan, under $10 I believe. #1 Roku was purchased March 2020 & in June 2021 it just stopped working. Being able to utilize the protection plan at that point made those few dollars on the initial purchase worth it. Within less than 1 week I had a new Roku. We love this due to the ton of streaming options. It’s very easy to use. We have a Smart LG & had no issues installing or in using it. The picture quality is great. The remote is super easy to use & is compact. We still have a cable provider but knocked that bill in half due to owning this. My 4 star reflects my expectation for longevity. #1 Roku broken within 15 months, well I hope my #2 does have the longevity. For the cost of Roku & the quality livestreaming experience, I do recommend this. I’ll also add I recommend the protection plan as well","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2021","mesh",360

It crashes back to the Sling menu within 20 seconds. Restarting the show seems to work. A lot of FF and rewind can also cause crashes. I am using 5 Ghz which seems slightly better than 2.4 Ghz.

They said as of Sept 10th my regular roku tv’s wouldn’t of worked anymore either if I didn’t pay this fee. I asked to speak with a supervisor. I was basically told the same thing. So I asked to speak to HIS supervisor. I was told due to the high call volume his supervisor would return my call in 30 minutes. It’s over an hour and a half later. No call. My roku TV’s are no longer working which they were BEFORE this phone call. Neither is my log in info so I can’t edit anything. I have searched and searched to try to find a way to contact roku. I was finally able to get on hold with their technical help. My time is climbing. I have been on hold for 30:58 and it was at a 38 minute wait when I first called it’s now at 44 minutes.

"HDCP Error???","Can’t say if it works or not. I ordered the basic Roku on 11/26 and it arrived on 11/29. Went to set it up on my new Vizio tv so we could watch Disney + and it only fits the side facing hdmi port. But, we got a message indicating hdcp error. Roku says I can get a FREE dongle to access the other ports on the tv so I ordered it right away on 11/29. It is now 12/5, the mail has arrived, no dongle. We missed watching Disney+ last weekend and now it’s looking like we will miss another weekend. Funny thing is it worked on a small older Panasonic tv we had but watching on the small tv kind of defeated the purpose. I’m very disappointed.Update: The dongle arrive in the mail today.

"Don't get taken advantage of","I was trying to replace my Fire tv since Amazon is going downhill. I thought I purchased the one that supports a headset, but that feature got lost in all the other features you have to look out for. Then I realized the reason they have a headset jack on some of their models is because they don't support blue tooth. Function of the buttons on the remote are also very spongy compared to fire tv. You have to push the buttons several times and point the remote in the right direction to get it to work. In today's day of electronics, this needs to go back to the 1980's.

"ROKU Streaming Stick not for older HD TVs","We have a Samsung HD 4K TV, but I bought this streaming stick to use primarily with a 10-year-old Samsung flat screen with 1080i / 720p resolution. It didn't work with the old TV: pink pixelated display with faintly visible menu. It worked perfectly with the HD 4K. So 5 stars for new HD TVs, 0 stars for older models.. If I were rating this just on support, I would give ROKU 1 star. The tech person I reached by phone didn't know what she was talking about. I gave her detailed specs for the old TV and she kept insisting that the HDMI port on my TV was defective even though I kept telling her that the port worked perfectly when I used it for other devices. I also submitted a ticket, which ROKU responded to several times, but only to say they were still looking into it. Finally, three or four days later, a response to the ticket, with an apology for the delay, recommended getting the ROKU EXPRESS PLUS. I did. The HDMI connection worked perfectly so I didn't need to use the RCA cable - the ""Plus"" - that was included in the package. So maybe the ROKU EXPRESS would have worked just as well.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2018","River View",364

"Serves Ads and Requires CC, Address, Phone, Email to Setup","Roku requires the user to create an account to use streaming services on their device. This isn't an issue in itself...but they also require a payment method (credit card or PayPal) and address despite the fact that I have no desire to purchase any services or apps from Roku directly. Additionally, they serve ads to the user. Now, I realize this isn't an issue for many, but these reasons are sufficient for me to return the device. I will not surrender my CC info, phone number, and address to yet another business - especially one who I am not intending to purchase services from. And I will NOT be served ads on a device by the company I've paid to provide the device.

Even with fast wifi there is some delay in streaming- especially in comparison to my Ultra on Ethernet, but reliable, and very clear visuals.

Once everything was loaded on my new stick - been working smoothly, no wifi signal issues, although I live in a home not apartment.

This means the second she turns the tv on, the Roku automatically boots and displays on the HDMI port I plugged it into. In addition, I like the Roku interface.

The remote is smaller and clumsier to handle. It does not have a jack for headphones but that was not important. Hookup to an unused HDMI input and a USB port on the TV was easy and neat.

While setup was pretty easy I began to notice the following problems over the next month. I am going to be returning this product soon.1. Roku boots up (goes through bouncing Roku screen) and then gets stuck at black screen. I never get the Roku home screen. This becomes more problematic if you turn on the TV and play Xbox. Switching back to HDMI with Roku never gets off black screen.2. Roku home screen hangs frequently. When the Roku reaches the home screen, often the Roku becomes unresponsive. I see that the Roku stick light flashes when I click on remote but the home screen is stuck.3. Left 1/3 side of the screen is lighter than middle or right. I got an OLED TV specifically for the ""true black"" and unfortunately the Roku apps (Netflix, Xfinity, etc.) all have a light ghosting on left 1/3 of screen. I tried plugging it into different HDMI ports but found the same issue. Watching Netflix on the Xbox works just fine with no ghosting.So the Roku stick is most useful for moving between TVs in my home if kids are playing Xbox and I want to watch TV.

"What's Happened to Roku?","UPDATE: As you can see from my original review, I was very happy with Roku after my first purchase. I continued to be happy for well over a year when I starting having problems with the Roku screen freezing when I transferred from my Directv to the Roku stick. The problem persisted until I finally decided to buy a newer stick, thinking it would, of course, clear up the problem. Unfortunately, the setup on the newest purchase (just last week) did not go well. Lots of things went wrong, but I finally got it up and working...until I realized I couldn't sign in to my Showtime account, which is purchased through Roku. After being on customer service chat for at least an hour, they finally gave me a fix. And then...a day after that, I started experiencing the exact same problem with the remote--it freezes when I pull up Roku. The only fix I've found is to unplug the unit, plug it back in, take out the batteries, and pair the remote with the TV again. Nope. I've contacted Roku again. If they're not able to offer a real fix, I'm returning the stick. This appears to be a known issue (read the one star reviews). Why in the world isn't Roku fixing this?!ORIGINAL REVIEW: I've been using an Amazon Fire Stick for several years, and, though I love Amazon, I was never totally happy with it as a media device. It was very limited and balky, and in recent months it needed to be rebooted every time I wanted to use it.I'd heard good things about Roku, so I grabbed this at a great deal. It works like a dream! It' much more intuitive and user-friendly than the Amazon Fire Stick (which has now been relegated to a less-used TV).I heartily recommend this device.

"Stay Away if you want Peacock or HBO Max","This used to be a device that you bought, you downloaded your services, and you streamed. You were the customer. Not any more. Now you buy the device, but you can only stream from services that Roku can monetize you with, either by taking a share of the advertising, forcing the service to integrate into and/or provide content for, the Roku Channel, or letting Roku take some of the service’s ads. You are now the product, not the customer. So if a service doesn’t cave to Roku’s demands, you can’t watch that service on Roku and need to buy an additional, neutral, streaming solution that let’s you watch your content.

"Remote's glitchy, customer support's MIA","I've had a Roku 3 for six years, and it still works fine. Upgraded a few months ago to a Streaming Stick, mainly for the supposedly improved remote, and connected the old device to the downstairs TV. Unfortunately, the ""improved"" remote cuts out on a regular basis, sometimes for a few seconds, sometimes for way longer than that. My wi-fi hums, and the Roku app on my phone works even when the remote cuts out. So the problem is the remote. I've changed the batteries, re-paired it with the stick, shaken and stirred it. But nothing helps for long. I'd ask for a new one but nobody's minding the store.Called customer support 3x today and it was unreachable -- phone tree goes in circles, eventually tells you to try again later. Website's no help.

Setup was very easy, and everything worked perfectly right out of the box.We only needed the international channel on one TV, but we are cord cutting at the same time. What I found was that the stream through this Roku was vastly superior to the stream through our TVs app alone, so I ordered a second one.

One other annoying thing is why does it occasionally asks you for confirmation after you’ve clicked one of the dedicated app buttons? For example I click Hulu, then it asks me if I’m sure, click the left arrow to get to YES then click the OK button. That’s two extra, unnecessary clicks. Isn’t the point of the dedicated app button to avoid unecessary steps and go straight to the app? It doesn’t do it all the time, just sometimes, which is weird.

"I'm mostly pleased","First off, I want to be clear that activation of the Roku device is free. Purchasing the device is the only money you pay to Roku. If you have somehow end up on a website claiming that you have to pay them an activation fee or an upgrade fee just to be able to use your Roku device then you have navigated to the wrong address and it is a scam. What you do have to pay for, if you choose to do so, is any of the paid subscription streaming services you want. Some services require a paid subscription and some don't. To name a few: Watching basic YouTube (the same ones you watch for free on your phone, tablet, or computer), Tubi TV, Pluto TV, and hoopla (if available through your public library) are all free of charge. Netflix, Amazon Video, CBS All Access, YouTube TV, and Apple TV+ charge a monthly fee, but that has nothing to do with whether or not you use a Roku device to access their content.We bought a TCL Roku TV a couple years ago and, between Netflix and Prime, found that we weren't watching cable television anymore. So we downgraded to internet-only service through our cable provider and got this stick for our bedroom TV.Unlike some of the less expensive Roku offerings, the remote that comes with this one does both TV power and volume, so as long as you're getting all your content through Roku (and never need to switch inputs to, say, cable/satellite/antenna service or a DVD player) you don't need to have a separate TV remote. I was surprised the remote doesn't have a mute button, though. Our TCL Roku TV's remote had such a button. So if you're a heavy user of the mute button you may find that this does not in fact save you from needing a separate TV remote. I'm also a little troubled that our Roku TV, which we bought new only about two years ago, doesn't support Apple TV+. This particular streaming stick does support it. But it seems like a couple years is way too early for a streaming device to be even starting to creep into obsolescence. I have no interest in buying a new Roku stick every few years, and hope this isn't a sign of what's to come.If you have a home server for media, be aware that the Roku Media Player app is terrible. It only supports a fairly minimal set of formats, requires a UPnP/DLNA server and doesn’t support a simple SMB file share, and it just seems a little buggy sometimes. People would tell you the correct thing to do is to install Plex, and they’re probably right, but seriously can’t I just play files that are available over my network? Any computer or smartphone could do it. We desperately need a VLC app for Roku.It's also clear that the Roku stick has no idea whether the TV is on or off. This means that (unless the Roku is being petted by a USB port on the TV that turns off when the TV does) if you just push the power button on the remote in the middle of watching something, it will keep playing--and perhaps even advance automatically to the next show. This means you'll lose your place in a series and, perhaps more importantly, will consume more power and data. So remember to stop playback when you turn off the TV. Or get one of those power strips that automatically turns off accessories when the master device turns off. (Or buy a Roku TV instead of a separate TV and Roku stick--but remember my comment above about sliding into obscelescence.)If you're looking for free entertainment, there are some options but you probably won't find them up to par with paid cable TV or perhaps even with free over-the-air TV. Tubi has some content, including a ""Not on Netflix"" section. Pluto TV is okay--it has a lot of channels, but they're largely underwhelming. There's a local news ""channel"" that in our case gives us content for the nearest big city, an hour away, rather than our actual local news stations. The Roku Channel occasionally has a movie worth watching. Your public library may offer some content through Hoopla as well. So there are some free options, but you're unlikely to be completely satisfied without some form of paid entertainment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2019","Picocosm",376
"Works Great","I am old, old, old ""school"" and do not use the voice recognition feature. I'm a button-kind-of-guy, but the fewer the better, and this one is just right, EXCEPT for a couple of features. First, of course, you need a good quality (does not mean expensive) streaming TV and Internet. Quality of ours (Roku) is pretty good. The features I do NOT like are:The size of the remote/stick might be OK for a child's hand but it is difficult for man hands. It is also super slick, like slide-out-of-my-hand slick. Lastly from me, the volume control on the side is awkward to use, and there is an echo/feedback situation competing with our sound bar unless I put this remote on mute. Even then, I or someone else sometimes inadvertently touch the up/down volume buttons and have to hit mute again if I notice the interference with the TV sound bar. Functionally, the device works great (and there are a lot of programming choices), but the design of the handheld REALLY needs improvement.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2020","rweakswa",376

"Remote is garbage","We're big fans of Roku (and have like 3 in the house), but the streaming stick has been our least favorite product from them yet. I selected the streaming stick specifically because the remote is supposed to be MORE responsive, and the results were the opposite. The remote loses connection frequently - literally every night now - and seemingly at random, forcing us to resort to clunky phone apps to control our TV. And some of these phone apps even have ads. My wife had to watch a 30 second commercial last night just to hit pause on the 'Ted Bundy Tapes.' Why is this a thing?That said, the streaming quality is great, the picture comes in in 4K, and everything else is as advertised. It's much smaller than your typical Roku which is a nice space-saver too.

"FRUSTRATING!","Bought this product brand new about a year ago. For the first few months, five stars - completely reliable, lots of content options, perfect way to ease the family into cutting the cord from standard cable TV service.And then it got flaky. Random reboots while watching content, frozen screens when powered up, flaky network connection. Tried multiple reboot/restart/reset strategies and ended up finally getting a RMA and returning the stick to the company (which is a bit of a painstaking process in itself).After a couple of weeks they mailed back a brand new stick. Which of course worked flawlessly. For a while. After another month this one went into an endless cycle of repeating the boot screen (where the Roku letters dance). Rebooting, resetting, nothing - just the boot screen, over and over. After a couple weeks of trying resets, unplugging, etc. the device froze up completely and the HDMI input reports no signal.Seriously, the MOST frustrating piece of electronic equipment I've ever owned or dealt with.Roku itself is awesome. We also have an Ultra box connected to another TV, and just replaced this hideous stick with another Ultra box.

"2 days of using and it is great!!!","Set up took maybe 15 minutes by creating an account and finding the TV, it streamed nextflix and YouTube perfectly. I still need to use TV remote to turn on and volume. For some reason my Rocky remote wont work with volume and on or off, It stated it couldn’t find my tv and I went through all 53 possibilities. But my LG that’s 3 years old doesn’t seem to have a connection with it. Overall though it streams great!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2020","Bryan B",383
"Awful","It constantly reboots itself and we have to sign back into everything. Does not have enough memory to store seemingly any apps. Roku Customer Service (which I would give zero stars to) says it is because the tv does not have enough power and it needs to be plugged into the wall (I have tried it on both of my relatively new Sony TVs). That would defeat the whole purpose of having a streaming stick. I have several other Roku products which are fine but this streaming stick is completely terrible and you should definitely not bother with it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2021","Brian T Dwyer",383

My main concern is that is uses up batteries in about 2-3 weeks. I tried several different brands and eventually went to rechargeable a that were always charging in the room with it. I eventually pulled out my appletv and resumed using it.

"RokuTV is GARBAGE! Don’t waste your money","The RokuTV stick is absolute TRASH. We have had this for less than 30 days and dealt with constant freezing of the actual stick - not an internet problem. Today, it froze so many times that we had to engage the “reset” functions, which makes you set up the stick like “new” which is pretty inconvenient. More inconvenient is the fact that it never got through the entire setup without freezing again. It is now completely unusable. We have 2 amazon fire sticks that we have had longer than this and both work perfectly - no freezing. What’s more - the cost is higher than the superior fire sticks. We only purchased this because it’s the only device Xfinity allows for streaming of their live tv app, but it’s not worth it. We are returning and will never buy another Roku product again. We also hated that there’s no mute button on the remote.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2019","Kori",383

The UI is quick and easy to navigate. Streaming is good and covers all the major apps available.Top of the line is still the Nvidia Shield TV in my opinion, but that is not needed for secondary TVs.

The WiFi connection is the best I have ever encountered in any device. It connects to my WiFi router (on another floor) when other devices (like the TV) fail. I bought it to play Netflix, VUDU, etc. because my smart TV stopped being smart after two years and now cannot properly connect to those services. The Roku has everything I need and more.

I have other ROKU's and have experienced no problems with them.This one, however, is junk. It overheats. It goes nuts and throws a black screen with an error and several steps to correct. The correction does not work for long and the error repeats. In addition the voice if often out of sync with the picture and the picture itself lacks the quality of my FireStick.I contacted ROKU via their website support and discovered the worst customer support I have ever encountered.I am hoping that my device is defective and a replacement will solve the problem but I am getting nowhere with ROKU.So bottom line.

I spent hours with them, Amazon and Comcast trying to get the Roku connected to my Wi-Fi network. I specifically asked if there were any password restrictions and was told no. We did a replacement drill that took another couple of days with the same results. As a last resort, I changed my Wi-Fi password to a simpler one with no special characters. The Roku connected immediately. Roku support has yet to follow up with the ticket they created 4 days ago. The password requirements should either be addressed as a Roku software issue, or published as a restriction. At the end of the day, I had to change over 20 devices in my home to use the new password (laptops, phones, iPads, cameras, doorbells, thermostats, alarm systems, printers etc.). Now that it is working, I do like the Roku picture and sound.

Sometimes the audio begins to lag, expecially on ATT TV recorded programs. On other services, sometimes the audio with drop out completely or suddenly become very loud, clipping the audio.Some other reviews have said that these problems are with the audio source, BUT I DO NOT HAVE THESE PROBLEMS ON ANY OF THE TELEVISIONS THAT USE THE AMAZON FIRESTICK.I finally was able to talk with someone at Roku back in July about the issue. Roku has several audio settings and they suggested that I try a different setting(s). I did this for a while and it seemed to work. However, the problems never completely went away. I have tried various audio settings to no avail. Again, I do not have these issues with the Amazon Firestick, so I do not believe it is solely the fault of the source.I have tried over the last few weeks to talk to someone at Roku, but I have found ZERO phone support. I have checked their knowledge base to no avail.So, while this was one my favorite product, I am now about to replace them if I cannot find a resolution.

If you search a movie it doesn't seem to tell you all the streaming services are playing it, similar to the way Xfinity or Firestick does.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2020","HZTandy",388

"Remote control died after two months.","The quality of the stick itself and the streaming it provides is perfectly fine, but my remote control stopped working after about 2 months (yes, I checked/replaced the batteries). A replacement remote is $20, which is roughly 50% of the total cost of the full product. I cannot justify shelling out another $20 to replace the remote. I explored the possibility of migrating to a universal remote, but could not find any reasonably priced options that are compatible with Roku's sticks.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2021","Chris J",388

"Actually Works as Well as Promised, Better Than Our Govt!","So far this year, we've ordered four streaming + sticks for 4 in-house and one RV usage. The sticks work great. Long range RF remotes mean I can irritate the Wife Unit by changing streaming channels from two rooms away. These are our first streamers and they are light years ahead of the two Samsung ""smart"" TVs. Near instantaneous response to channel changes as measured against our zzzz response to channel changes from DISH TV. The voice recognition works about 80% of the time. That is good since I search for some weird stuff when going down the you tube video rabbit hole. They are all 4 happy with our regular 50 MB AT&T wifi and work even down to <13 MB/sec on 2.4/5 GHz after the signal goes through a wifi extender which isn't really needed (used for jamming neighbor's way-over-powered wifi). No pausing and plenty of buffering. They struggle a little (intermittant signal loss outrunning the buffering) with the campground wifi since it is always overloaded but it is not really a current problem since CA ""science"" says the virus can jump, from one campsite 150' to another, and has closed our campgrounds. We really like being able to get real news and grand-punkin programming in higher res than the compressed DISH signals. If there are any minuses, it would be that I accidentally keep hitting the 4 direct-tune buttons on the bottom two rows of the remote. We don't subscribe to any of the pay-to-streamers there. After the warranty is gone maybe I'll open up the remotes and disable the buttons. We were not able to get a ROKU streaming channel to work through ROKU even with their help once. They tried but couldn't get it to work even through the designers of the channel. We recommend the ROKU streaming stick+. So far, no stick failures amongst four of them. Be sure to order the free little HDMI extension asap from the site in the instructions with your serial #. It is great stress relief for the HDMI connection to the TV. We power two of the sticks off of the USBs on the TVs and two of the sticks with their USB wall wart power supply. No diff except for about 30 second ROKU reset after turning on TV if using TV USB connection for power. No, nobody compensated me for this spew. We like our ROKUs!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2020","Grumpa",388
"Trading in the Old Roku","It takes a lot for me to change. I'm not one to need the newest and best. Just a pragmatic kinda-guy. But WOW! The Roku Streaming Stick FAR EXCEEDED my expectations. My old Roku was so stinking slow! It was slow to boot up. It would pause to upload during a show. It was even slow to receive remote commands. I got a ChromeCast for Christmas but since I don't have a Smart TV I found it almost useless. I exchanged it for this Roku Streaming Stick and am absolutely delighted. Super fast at all the above. Voice commands are solid. Vast selection of FREE Streaming Channels. Easy connection to my subscriptions.

"Disappointed!","So I was really excited to upgrade my Roku from my older version which was okay, but I wanted 1080p, volume controls and voice recognition which I hardly use btw. Everything seemed fine until I started to notice glitches, unfortunately at the moment I use WiFi to connect to the Roku remote app on my iPhone so that I can use my Bluetooth headphones. I don’t have a smart tv with Bluetooth yet but now I’m definitely going to buy one ASAP!!First issue is every time I connect to Netflix and browse around for a bit & once I get to about the 3rd or 4th preview it automatically disconnects from the Roku app on my phone! I then have to reconnect it and it’s getting so annoying now! It’s only when I use Netflix. The Hulu app is the only one I don’t have issues with browsing or rewinding. Unfortunately there’s also issues with Amazon video when I try to rewind, it starts to buffer so I have to go back to the home page then reconnecting the Roku remote app to watch a movie or show. I’m not sure if it’s a glitch with the actual stick or the Roku remote app on my iPhone, but it’s starting to become very annoying. Now I’m thinking of buy a smart tv with Bluetooth so I don’t have to deal with these annoying glitches.Good luck!","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2021","A.Del.",389

"Disappointing compared to Fire Stick 4K","I own a Fire Stick 4K, which I like, but the UI is confusing. The Roku stick, piece of cake. It's super easy to set up and use. From there, it goes downhill.I have an LG C9 OLED TV that supports all the latest and greatest video technologies. The Fire Stick supports Dolby Vision, which looks AMAZING on my TV. The Roku does not, and even though it supports HDR, the picture is much too bright. Whites hurt my eyes and everything looks artificial. Ok, so I could change my TV settings I'm sure....but that won't fix the next problem with the Roku......which is constant freezing. My router is about 3 feet from the TV, so there's no way the signal is too weak. No matter the app, the picture on the Roku constantly freezes. I can watch a stream for 8-10 mins, then freeze. Then another 8-10 mins, then freeze again. Not to mention the remote will become unresponsive within apps, causing me to have to exit back to the home screen and restart the app.I'll keep the Roku and put on a spare TV for now, but next time Amazon has a sale on Fire Sticks, it's getting replaced. It's a bummer because the UI is drop dead simple....but if I can't actually stream anything, what's the point?","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2021","Dan",390

We started with more basic sticks from both Roku and Amazon, but both of the more basic sticks could not maintain a streaming speed in our location to prevent interruptions of the programs being watched. Thus, we bought the Roku Streaming Stick + because it was advertised having more range and a faster processor. So far, we have had no streaming problems with the Roku Streaming Stick +.

Picture quality is good most of the time, sometimes looks poor but eventually clears up. My biggest complaint would be the REMOTE. YOU NEED THE REMOTE FOR THE ROKU DEVICE TO FUNCTION!!! but the design is poor. I have to reconnect the remote EVERY DAY and often it will not connect at all. I have contacted Roku about this but they never responded. They have many problems with this and all they offer is a ""how to"" for connecting your remote. Unplug tv, unplug roku stick, remove batteries from remote, plug back in, turn on, put in batteries, press button...AND IT STILL DOES NOT WORK! You can use the Roku app on your phone as a remote but this wears down your battery and monopolizes your phone if you want to use it for anything else. You know, to make a phone call or something... Roku should be a great product but with a defective remote it is really frustrating and annoying to use.

My hours of googling suggested that If you use ARC over HDMI to connect your sound bar to your TV, Roku TV can use CEC to control the sound bar’s volume (maybe). But, if you're hooked up by optical out - you are going to have to buy a logitech smart hub to get one controller.But, all my gripes are about the remote and lack of control.

"Really good product. Had a little trouble with Roku customer ...","Really good product. Had a little trouble with Roku customer service initially. The extension cable for the A/C adapter was defective; it would lose power randomly. After diagnosing there was nothing wrong with the product itself I attempted to procure a replacement cable from Roku. The customer representative wanted me to send the entire unit back to Roku and they would send me a replacement unit. When I insisted that I only needed the cable and not the whole unit replace I was told I had to send the whole unit back which was frustrating. Ended up keeping everything and just throwing the cable away. No problems to date since. Makes it a lot nicer to stream on our tv instead of a computer. There are a lot of apps available for different channels. One thing that is frustrating though is there is no antenna app built into the streaming stick. It seems that you have to buy a roku tv to have the functionality of not switching between an hdmi connection and tv itself. Also I have noticed that you cannot just turn off the roku stick itself. I've found that the stick creates some kind of interference that will block over the air reception. Often we have to unplug the power to Roku stick to get the over air reception to our tv. While a little annoying it doesn't outweigh the overall good things the streaming stick bring to our television experience. If your looking for something to use streaming services to your tv and have the ability to add other things down the road like stereo hookup or portability this is a great buy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2018","Robbie",398

I did find from the get go that the remote was a bit iffy, or it may have been occasional very slow response. Geo-restriction is a problem, and I could not access Amazon Prime. (I could watch Prime on my Smart TV).I signed up for Acorn TV, but could not load it from the Roku channel store. Roku support told me Acorn was geo-restricted, but Acorn said not. (Again, I could watch on my smart TV).The worst has been Wifi related. Often, when I was downstairs watching Netflix, my wife would call me upstairs as the Roku had stopped working. It had dropped from the wifi network, but was easy to reset, at first. Finally, the unit lost wifi connection, and just would not see my wifi, although it variously saw 3 to 7 of my neighbours' networks.

It is unuseable. It is set up correctly and every couple of days we may be ale to watch a show. It finds my network fine and indicates a full strength signal but still says it can't connect. Sometimes, when I re-enter the internet password it will connect for a short period then drops again. As in the title, it is totally useless. i have ordered another streaming device to replace it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2019","Stuart M. Pritchard, Jr.",399

"Great streaming, horrible remote","Good things first: this Roku does a fantastic job with streaming. I've never had network connection issues and the availability of apps is unrivaled.Now the bad: the remote is basically unusable. Unlike most of its competitors using Bluetooth, Roku went with a Wifi-driven remote. Every single day the remote loses its pairing. The only way to get it to reconnect is to place the remote right next to the device and mash buttons until it finally picks it back up. And then it'll routinely lose its connection to the remote as you are watching. Nothing more frustrating than trying to pause a show and having to wait 3 min before it will actually register your button presses! This is apparently a known problem and is compounded by the fact that our media console and wifi router are near one another.While I loved the device, I can't deal with the completely useless remote.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2019","Chris W.",402

The remote will always adjust the volume so it’s definitely a problem with the remote/Roku combination and not the tv. We have used other Roku systems without a problem but this one is junk!!! I would give zero stars if I could.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2021","Emily",405
"Worked fine for a a year and a half and then crapped the bed","I'm a fan of Roku and their interface. The stick worked fine until it didn't under two years later. I'm guessing the antenna crapped out because it wouldn't connect to wifi and can't read the remote. Unfortunately I'm out of warranty and really can't recommend this as Roku Support has been unhelpful. Welp.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2021","honk",405

"Roku TV and Roku sticks are not at all the same thing! Read carefully!","I have to say that I am disappointed in this purchase. I did fairly extensive research before deciding to buy the Roku Streaming Stick+, comparing it to Apple TV, Playstation Vue, Amazon Fire and others. I even read the Roku website and blog that says the following:BackgroundJust like your smartphone has an “app store” for installing new applications, you can access the Roku Channel Store on your Roku streaming player or Roku TV™ to add new “channels”. Channels are applications for your television, popular channels include Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, VUDU and HBO GO. Additionally, current generation Roku devices include access to The Roku Channel, which features hit movies and TV at no cost to you.Do I have to pay for channels?Although some channels must be purchased or require a paid subscription, many others allow you to watch movies and TV shows for free.Which channels allow me to watch movies and TV shows?There are many channels that offer movies and TV shows including popular choices like Netflix, Google Play, Vudu, FandangoNOW and Hulu.Search Movies & TV shows in the Roku Channel Store.Are there channels that allow me to watch live or local TV?Yes, there are live broadcast channels like ABC, NBC, CBS, HGTV and Fox. In addition, some cable/satellite companies are creating Roku streaming channels that allow you to access all or most of the channels you get through your cable subscription without having a separate cable box (e.g. Spectrum TV, Comcast Xfinity, DIRECTV NOW).If you have Roku TV, you can also connect an antenna to access live and local broadcast TV over the air.I got the distinct impression that I'd be able to watch my live and local broadcast TV via the Roku system. Wrong. Turns out that the Roku stick does not have an antenna slot, and the Roku channels provide ""live"" news that is actually not live. It's an amalgam of news recorded throughout the day and then recycled throughout the day on various channels. Further, when I tried to watch Saturday Night Live, I could only access archived Saturday Night Live episodes, or buy a separate subscription for the show. Hey, I'm used to watching it live, for free, over my HDTV antenna. So, I ended up switching back to my antenna. The only way to actually get what was advertised is to not buy the Roku stick, but, rather, to buy a Roku TV with an antenna slot that allows live and local broadcast TV to be processed via the Roku TV system, including pause and replay. Ya gotta read the fine-print!The only reason I'm still giving Roku 2 stars is because, in its own right, with all the caveats I've mentioned, it's not too bad. I'm hoping I can get used to having both the Roku stick and the HDTV antenna to serve my needs.Update May 27, 2018: my Roku stick stopped working. Not sure what happened. Power surge? Really don't know. But, after calling customer support and going through the usual ""Is it plugged in?... Have you tried a different outlet?..."" they finally gave me a return authorization, so now I'm waiting for a replacement.

"Great compact device, easy upgrade, remote works fairly well","Overall this was a great upgrade from our Apple TV 3rd gen. We are only using for 1080p content at the moment.Super small & portable.If you're already a Roku user, the interface is identical, at least to my 2018 TCL TV. The remote automatically paired with the IR on my 2012 LG Plasma, which I didn't want at first, but this meant that it works also with my Vizio soundbar for volume control, so that works well too.One gripe: every time you power off the TV, the Roku must start up again each time you turn it back on. This sometimes takes 30 seconds to fully become functional. Maybe this is just me, but worth noting if you turn your TV on and off several times per day.Another thing to mention, especially if you're coming from an Apple TV: the interface for each app is different, so it takes some getting-used-to.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2020","Wluttrell",414

"Nice little device for the price","Works quite well and easy to set up. I mainly only use it for NBA league pass and YouTube.I find the arrow pad on the remote a little difficult to use mainly because I'm used to this part of a remote being lower down so I can't always find the arrows by feel and have to look to make sure i have my finger on the right button. Once I have it in place though, it's fine.I also find some of the preset buttons a bit pointless because I don't use Sling, Hulu or Vue so these serve no purpose to me. Maybe these buttons should be programmable shortcuts?NBA League pass works really well. The interface isn't as clean as AppleTV and there is a little lag when switching between days to view games but this is only a minor thing.Once you select the game to play, it loads quickly and streams at the highest bitrate setting. It's easy to navigate through the stream but I wish the right arrow skipped 10 seconds without pausing the video and bringing up the time slider. Because it pauses the stream, you have to press the right arrow and then press enter so make it play which creates an extra step. This is annoying when watching a game a few hours after it has finished as it makes it tedious to skip through breaks in the game.YouTube works well and pretty much the same as on any smart TV. The only things I don't like (navigating, non-qwerty keyboard etc.) are due to the YouTube app itself, nothing to do with the Roku.Overall it's a great little device and works well for what I use it for (mainly NBA League Pass). Would probably give 4.5 or even 5 stars if the navigation of a stream was smoother as mentioned above.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2018","Amazon Customer",417

Got it over Amazon stick because Amazon is all about pay this pay for that, but Roku has so much to offer like freebie channels. Main reason was to get Showtime to play without paying for it through Amazon, because I already have an account.

"Good device but can be improved. The old versions are better.","I have been using Roku devices for years but this one has 3 issues:1- Remote takes a long time to start working. I thought that the long range controller was an advantage but its actually not as the controller deactivates after sometime and to reconnected at take up to 10 seconds to reconnect which is very annoying.2- If you are using this device outdoor it will just keeps going to the main menu: sometime 4G connection even though its fast disconnects for a very short time and while in other devices you will not feel a thing as there is a good buffer and it will continue working normally or maybe pause the stream for a short time or until your connection is back. The roku will close your application and bring you to the setting menu to select network and you have to set it up all over again after that u will have to go back to the application, wait for it to load, select your user, search again for the video and forward until the point where its stopped working.3- Voice controls are not compatible with netflix or youtube.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2019","Raed Almulla",418
"Streams great. Makes your tv smart!","We just got rid of our cable tv package, which was not my idea. I loved my dvr box. My husband has used a Roku stick for the past year. We do not have smart tv’s. Upon set up my husband swapped my new Roku stick for his older one because this newer Roku model is able to control the tv’s power and the volume control, eliminating the need for two remotes. There is definitely a learning curve to using a Roku stick and setting it up, at least there is for for us middle-aged parents. I’m not sure my elderly parents could figure this out. The only disappointment so far has been the Duracell batteries that came with the Roku stick were almost dead and it took me a while to figure that out as I thought the remote wasn’t working but it turns out the batteries were just dead. My husband prefers the Roku to the Firestick. We own both. This Roku comes with the charging block, remote, smart stick and an extension cable.

"WONDERFUL!!!!!","First time ever to use a Roku. Quick and easy to set up. I cut the cord 3 years ago and had been using a Samsung Blue Ray player to stream Netflix & YouTube to my 2014 LG Led HD TV (not a smart TV). I thought it was really great, until I received the Roku on December 21st. I watched a video on Amazon.com to see how to connect it to my TV. It took maybe less then 5 minutes total for me to have the Roku all set up and running and then I continued watching the movie I had been watching earlier on Netflix with the Blue Ray before the Roku came to my door, but now using the Roku. WONDERFUL!!! The quality of the picture is fantastic! Love that I only need one remote now. I am so happy with this product. No cords hanging, just used the HDMI (2) slot and the USB port and that was it. I still have my Blue Ray in the HDMI(1) spot to watch DVD""s. This device is incredible! One of my brother's asked me, ""is it legal?"" With all the stations available, with many FREE movies, I will NEVER go back to a subscription TV service again! THANK YOU ROKU!!!

"This is the one!","This streaming stick is the best yet from Roku. 4K and fast response from a stick format is a definite leap ahead. This is the first Roku stick format that doesn't feel like a compromise. Powers fine off the USB port on the back of my TV - just takes several seconds to boot up when I turn the TV on. I also really like that there is now TV power and volume right on the remote. I have the TV mounted on the wall with an extremely thin cord track that runs down with only the power cord. Made for a very easy and clean looking install. Roku has an extremely extensive channel lineup. I just wish they would update their interface. Voice search and app launch also works well.

Hopefully this does not lead to any issues with the device later on.**UPDATE**Running into overheating issues now. It started getting worse after watching 4K videos, and now the device overheats when I watch any show, regardless of quality. I read online that it can be resolved by purchasing an extender so that the Roku Stick would not be directly connected to the TV and/or rigging it with a heatsink.

"Solid performing streaming option","The Roku Streaming Stick+ has been a very positive experience thus far. This is the third different generation of Roku devices I have owned and probably my favorite so far. I like the ability to plug the stick directly into my TV through both the HDMI and USB for power. Doing so keeps the device hidden from view and doesn't take up any additional space. I was a little hesitant, at first, thinking the stick may not be sufficient for my household WiFi configuration, as I have gigabit fiber service, but this device would be utilized on a floor above the router in a room I previously used a hardwired streaming device. So far, though, the results have been great. Signal strength has been strong and I have not suffered any performance issues. I have also enjoyed the remote with this device. Private listening over the mobile app is a nice feature compared to the audio output on the remote on one of my other Roku devices.Overall, I have been impressed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2018","Tommy",434

"Good Product","The Roku Streaming Stick+ (3810R) is easy to install and the HDR quality on my older TV is beautiful. BUT....I am unable to install the Charter Spectrum app as ROKU no longer supports the app for LIVE TV. So if you are wanting to watch programming that is on cable TV in another room you can forget it. I spent 40 minutes with the tech at Spectrum who tried to figure out a work around and it can't be done. IF you already have the Charter Spectrum app on your TV and are just upgrading the stick then it may work with a Spectrum update through the app icon and pressing on the * icon on the Roku icon. I was able to do that with 2 Roku TVs that already had the app on it, but not with the new stick on a TV that never had Roku on it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2021","LB",437

"Long Term Reliability Issues Coupled with Iffy Customer Service","I bought a total of 7 of these sticks to use between our home and our condo later summer/early fall of 2019. The sticks are now about 7 months old, but any particular stick will have only been used for a maximum of 4 months. While initially pleased with the purchase, recent issues have changed my thoughts. I am now very concerned with long term longevity with these units. Of the 7, I now have pretty serious issues with 2 sticks. One has intermittent wifi connection issues that essentially began over nite. I've moved it around, rebooted, changed feeds, rebooted the router and wifi all to no avail. The second stick seems to have a problem with the HDMI plug on the stick itself. I started seeing some kind of copy protection warnings the requires a repower to clear. Both sticks are in our condo and have been used for roughly 4 months. To top it off, the 3rd condo stick is also now beginning to act it little odd while booting up - strange screen messages, etc. Again, a reboot seems to clear things out.

"Great upgrade with an odd hardware choice","I have been a ROKU user for years and already own two ""base"" units. I bought the stick mainly for travel. The performance on this unit is great. Menus are zippy, video looks clean. All in all great things. The main problem I have with this unit - and the reason for the 2-star rating - is their choice of power connector.For some inexplicable reason in 2021 they chose to use a USB MINI connector. That wasn't a typo: A USB MINI connector from the year 2000. While the entire world has standardized on either USB-C or Micro USB Roku decided it was a good idea to bring back the Mini connector. It boggles my mind that this choice was made. I can't think of a device in the past ten years which was released with only a USB MINI. Given that in my road kit I have nothing but USB micro and USB-C it's a big deal for a travel unit. It means I have to take the provided special USB Mini cable with me everywhere or load up on Mini adapters again. This is just completely, utterly wrong for a unit whose primary function is travel.While the performance upgrades are nice the power connector choice means this will not be a part of my road kit sorry to say. Very disappointed that they went this way for a travel-centric unit.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2021","chicagodave",451

It works well just too things, I get 1001 errors spastically that cuts off the video I'm watching which is a disconnect from the network thing. Not sure what the issue is (I understand they interrupt the streaming if you have been idle for quite awhile so you don't blow up data from mobil services) and I did do some research that says go into Roku settings, screensaver and unclick ""timeouts"" to off. This is a feature that once again if idle on one station for how ever long you set the minutes too, it goes to sleep with a screensaver you select. My biggest disappointment is the voice remote because it only works with the Roku home page does not operate on the app menu for live TV....Update: You have to be right on top of the TV for the remote to work so that means I have to get off the couch and go to the TV to increase the volume change channels etc. The purple rubber select/directional part is flimsy and I have to press it several times to get it to react.

"poor performance-","After several phone calls with tech support for router and Roku + device which ruled out router, and modem roku device became the only device in my wifi network with slow connection speed. This results in random pixelation and buffering. WiFi network is based on a brand new robust mesh system that is providing solid 230Mbps download to two phones and two computers and confirmed.

"works well but clumsy","Installed easily. Works well with PBS, Sling and AirTV2. Muting the sound was almost a deal breaker, but it seems Roku finally conceded that a mute button is a necessity. If you buy, be sure you're gettting a remote with a mute button. There are probably still a bunch, like mine, without one. Otherwise, you'll have to pay $20 for a replacement remote. For me, not having mute, was like going back to the 60's.2 issues that might be important: 1. support is off-shore and, from my experience, of the quality people make jokes about. Support people seem to have almost no experience with the product and their only priority is getting you to give up. You'll have to depend on the user group which is good. 2. The user experience is clumsy, not intuitive, awkward and poorly documented but if you work at it you'll usually figure it out.In the end, it is a good replacement for cable TV when used with some of the other products (""channels"") it supports.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2020","RP",458

Had to return this Roku because it overheated and replaced it with Firestick. I've added YouTubeTV so I can still have storage DVR and 110 local channels. Add a Voip phone option (OOMA) and voila!!! cord cut. Had to return as the stick overheated with warning messages frequently...major fire risk I suspect.Also with YouTubeTV app , Roku was redundant with the apps I have on my SmartTv and Amzon site subscriptions.FYI I love my breakup with C-x Cable. I now have the channels I WANT for 1/3 the bill, with better internet speed, and free phone service after my initial OOMA Telo purchase. Love performance of Cent--y Link DSL.

When researching how to get internet to our travel trailer that's going to be parked on our side lot, we ran in to many expensive installation options for a new antenna, satellites or various hubs.

With the two combined, I have flawless Wifi connection in the R-Pod and can stream all our favorite apps using the Roku+. The Netgear Extender is plugged in an outlet on my back lanai.

Well OK, after expressing my EXTREME displeasure to the friendly ROKU customer service rep, I received a $10.00 (WOW!) discount.My whole point was, that at the time of purchase, I saw no mention of a $57.00 ""one time"" registration fee. Either here on Amazon, or on the ROKU web site. If it was there, I somehow missed it. Should have been posted right up front - bold letters, & in plain English.Would I have purchased anyway? Maybe.

"Severe Audio Issues with AVR Surround Sound Systems","When I first purchased the Roku Streaming Stick+, I thought it was a nice improvement over my 1st Gen Amazon FireTV Stick with the Roku being able to search multiple apps for specific movies and television while the Firestick pushed Amazon products. Others have complained that the Roku interface looks dated but I found it to be familar and easy to navigate with a quick response time and very little lag. But that is where the positives end for the Roku.I connected the Roku Streaming Stick+ to my Yamaha RX-679 surround sound receiver via HDMI and it played fine at first. But then I started getting frequent, sporadic audio drops where the center channel would simply fade out and the volume would drop so low that it became inaudible. It would stay low for several minutes and then return to normal before repeating the audio issue. I tried numerous app updates, system restarts, system resets, updated the firmware on the Roku and the Yamaha receiver, switched HDMI ports and HDMI cables but nothing resolved the issue.Out of desperation, I returned the Roku Streaming Stick+ to Amazon and purchased a Roku Ultra hoping that would resolve the issue but it didn't. I contacted the Roku support team and listed all of the pertinent details in my original message before receiving a response that seemed to indicate most of my original message had went unread because I was being asked questions that I had already answered. I answered those same questions again and Roku support told me to disconnect the Roku from my AVR and connect it directly to the television, completely bypassing my surround sound system and just using the built-in television speakers.A quick internet search shows that Roku has had audio issues with surround sound systems as far back as Roku 3 and as recently as the Roku Premiere+ so I told the Roku support team to address the issues with their audio coding instead of asking customers to find subpar workarounds. After doing so, the Roku support team claimed that my Yamaha receiver was to blame, marked the claim as being ""resolved"" and closed the ticket.I had the FireTV Stick, a PS4 and an Xbox One all connected to the Yamaha receiver via HDMI and all of those devices played through my 7.1 surround sound system flawlessly. So it is obvious that Roku would rather place the fault within other components instead of taking responsibility for its own faulty software.My advice is to stay away from Roku if you have any kind of surround sound system. A sound bar may work with the Roku but it seems that audio systems with multiple audio channels will have problems with the Roku software and the Roku support team is completely useless in resolving these issues.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2019","James C.",471

Also, the image quality is greatly improved as well. The only thing that I am not sure is that useful is the voice feature, which I think might be better on the Amazon cube.

"Even though it's not a 4K TV the picture looks good at 1080p","We finally cut the cord. So I purchased the Streaming Stick + to attach to my semi-smart Vizio 60"" TV. Even though it's not a 4K TV the picture looks good at 1080p. This is our 5th Roku in the house, so setup was easy even setting up to power on and off the TV and volume control.The reason for the 3 stars are for the following reasons:1. Voice control is a bust. All of us tried to use the voice control we all received different results. Not sure if it's a learning curve thing or it still needs to grow.2. Remote not responding after a cold startup. It can take anywhere from 15 seconds to a minute for the Remote Status prompt to pop up and then the remote will respond to commands. Now this could also be a side effect of powering up the Roku when the TV starts, as I use the USB port on the TV to power the Roku, because I know my family will not put the Roku in standby when they power the TV off, so the Roku will continue to stream.4/15/18. Update. After reading the Roku stick troubleshooting FAQ, I discovered that some TV's HDMI ports don't play well with the Roku sticks or cause inference. Roku recommends installing the HDMI extender cable. (you can order one from Roku for free) I bought a 3 and 1 HDMI spilter and set the Roku stick in plain view of the remote and no more remote issues.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2018","Keith H.",474

"The Roku Channel now showing hundreds of free movies & Locast has free CBS/NBC/FOX/ABC/PBS","I've been a Roku user for years,including several different models. Roku has recently released The Roku Channel,which has hundreds of free movies.It is ad supported.And now Locast app gives you free local broadcast stations CBS,NBC,FOX,ABC and PBS.Locast now offers local TV network broadcasts for New York,Boston,Chicago,Houston,Dallas,Denver areas and plans to add many more cities.This means many folks will no longer need antennas to watch local networks for free. Roku has just about every app you can imagine (YouTube/Pandora/Netflix/Amazon/Hulu/HBO Now) and thousands of more apps in many different categories.This Roku Streaming Stick PLUS does have more advanced WiFi antenna than the regular Streaming Stick.Here are some points to consider when deciding on which model of Roku to buy:1)If you need to connect by WiFi in a room far away from your WiFi router,I would recommend the Roku Streaming Stick PLUS or Roku Ultra.2)If you have a 4K TV,I would recommend the Roku Ultra or Roku Streaming Stick PLUS.The Premiere 2018 model also plays 4K.3)To search for content using your voice,go with either the Streaming Stick,Streaming Stick PLUS or Ultra.All 3 of these models also have a remote that can control the power and volume on a TV.There is also a Roku app for Android & iPhone/iPad that lets you use your smartphone/tablet to control any Roku device and use your phone/tablet on-screen keyboard for searches.4)If you want a wired ethernet connection,go with the Roku Ultra.5)If you want to connect to an old TV with RCA/Composite audio/video jacks,you will need the Express PLUS6)The Express & Premiere 2018 models have a remote where it has to be pointed at the device,unlike the other Roku models.7)If you are only going to buy one Roku device,I would recommend the Roku Ultra.The Ultra has many unique features that the other Roku models don't such as:-Gaming buttons to play video games-Remote finder to find a lost remote control-Ethernet port for a wired connection-Micro SD card slot-USB Port-Night listening mode (this lowers the volume of loud,explosive sounds and raises the volume of soft sounds like whispers.Very useful!)-Headphone jack on the remote for listening without disturbing othersBottom Line:You can now get a Roku device to replace your cable TV box & service or to replace an antenna for free local network TV.And of course you can create your own custom TV experience that simply is not possible with cable or antenna TV.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2020","Michael K.

"Slower than the Express.","I have 3 Roku devices. One old slow non 4k stick, the Roku Express, and now the Streaming Stick, for 3 TVs. Originally the Express was being used on our primary TV but I bought the Streaming Stick for it because of the additional capabilities of the remote. That works as well as it should. The Streaming Stick, however, is not near the Express as far as visual quality, including clarity and color. And it is also much slower than the Express. I keep all of them updated, and occasionally power cycle them just to keep them cleared of residual bits of data that build during normal use. The Stick requires a reboot or power cycle constantly, especially after shifting from say Hulu to Netflix, or other services. Is it enough to make me drop it and get another Express? No. It's a streaming device for a decent price that does what it's advertised to do. To expect perfection, Champaign on beer money, would be foolish.

"Remote control issues ruin this Roku","This is my third Roku, and it's the first one with a remote problem. Presumably it's because it's now a stick instead of a box, so it's plugged into the back of my stereo receiver. The remote was unreliable out of the box, and when I checked on the Roku website I was told to order a free ""extension cord"" for the Roku, to get it away from the HDMI ports. That has only helped a bit. Every time I turn on the stereo and Roku, the remote is unworkable for a while. I keep pushing buttons and then all of a sudden it's good. But then later on it might stop working again. I checked the batteries in case they sent me some that were nearly dead, but the meter says they are good.Why is Roku selling a device that supposedly has a long-distance RF remote when the RF signal apparently isn't strong enough to overcome interference? The Fire TV stick plugged in next to it has no remote problems at all. I may return this.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2018","Kindle Customer",480

"Easy setup, clean interface, but no control over data usage","This was my 1st Roku device, and my 2nd streaming ""stick"" (the other one being a Fire TV stick 2019 generation). I had read articles comparing the 2 and thought Roku might be better. It was nicer in some ways, but lacking in one important feature area - data saving and data monitoring.Pros:-Easy setup (about the same as my Fire TV Stick)-Clean interface (less ads and overall easier than Fire TV Stick)-Lots of apps/channels (about the same as Fire)-Xfinity Stream beta app works better on Roku than on Fire right nowCons:-Had to find special link to signup for Roku without giving them a credit card. I pay for my streaming services by signing up directly with Netflix, Disney+ etc and didn't want Roku in the middle of that, especially just to get started and try it out. But if you like to buy a single movie ""on demand"" thru any Roku channel, you'd want to have a credit card on file, so maybe this wouldn't be a big deal to some.-Volume & especially the Mute buttons located on side of remote are easily clicked by accident while holding the remote in your hand-Couldn't get the Roku remote to control my TV to change the input to the right one for watching the roku-Can't install Firefox web browser for full surfing (can do this on Fire, its clunky but a nice option to have)-Can't put it into Sleep mode for low power and no data usage (Fire stick does have this)-Can't see any data usage by app/channel...Fire TV Stick allows this under Settings>Preferences>Data Monitoring. It is a nice way to see how much a particular app is using so that you can attempt to control data usage in that app's settings (or choose to watch things in the lower usage apps). i.e., Disney+ defaults to a very high streaming quality using 3-4Gb per hour. At least you can change that quality within their app to save data. But having the Fire stick show you the usage per app is a handy way to evaluate which apps are data hogs. Roku doesn't have this feature.-Can't limit the streaming quality (aka data usage) in the Roku Stick settings - there was a hidden option at one time that may have done this (Bit Rate Override). You can still get into that setting but it doesn't appear to work anymore and the Roku support forum reply is basically saying ""sorry, too bad"" because hidden/developer features are not intended to be supported so this isn't a bug. Jeez, that's lousy - fair point in the software world, but this was a hidden feature discussed all over the internet and used by many prior to 2019. Roku forum also suggests you should set your home router to limit the data used by the device - not all routers can do that by device, not all users can do that.So, look, I'm sure some of you will think the data usage issue isn't Roku's fault, blame your ISP for putting caps, use the features within your channels/apps to limit usage, etc. A few of our streaming svc apps/channels give you the ability to throttle the data usage with quality/bit rate settings, but most do not. I don't think its too much to ask a long-established streaming device maker to include a feature for this. And since the Amazon Fire TV Stick does this, I'm going to return this Roku and get a 2nd Fire stick when they go on sale.I did really like the cleaner interface on the Roku and wanted to like it enough that I could give one to my 70+ yr old parents, but not if I can't easily limit their data usage at the stick.

"Roku is a quality device, with 2 glaring exceptions.","Roku is a quality product, but I have 2 big complaints: 1.) Poor customer service; 2.) an ongoing customer scam when the Roku device doesn’t fit into a customer’s tv hdmi port. Mine did not fit, but when I applied for Roku’s so-called “free” hdmi extension, as suggested, the roku website would not allow me to complete the process. And, yes, everything was filled out correctly, including the serial number. To cover all bases, I also tried applying for my “free” extension on both my iPhone and my iPad. So I’m returning the device. This was a frustrating waste of my time. Also, I have read similar complaints from other customers. Reaching someone from Roku customer service was impossible. So I can only conclude that this whole charade regarding the “free” Roku extension is intentional. Otherwise, it would be just a stupid oversight, which seems unlikely considering that Roku has set up this fake process in recognition that its devices do not fit all TV hdmi slots. A word of advice, Roku: If it doesn’t fit, simply tell the customer to return your device. That would serve them much better than this ongoing scam.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2021","Salvatore V. Recchi",484

"Problems out the gate","I bought two new Roku Streaming Stick+. One of the roku's, when turned on, shows a night-time image with flashing screen. It has to be powered off and powered back on a 2nd time to work. When it powers on the 2nd time, there is a 30 second delay in the remote working.Roku Streaming Stick + #2 seems to work ok, but there is also a 15-20s delay in the remote working properly upon powering on. The voice control would be good if it worked with all installed apps. ... but it doesn't appear to (could be user error). But overall, there is a problem with both of them and it kinda sucks and I'm probably going back to satellite television.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2019","Amazon Customer",494

"Not for daily use.","At first it seemed to work ok but the longer we used it the worse it got. Whenever it would go into sleep mode I would push every button on the remote to try to wake it up and nothing would work, I would have to go directly to the roku stick and push the home button for it to finally come out of sleep mode. Also after time the audio would get behind the video and I would have to pause the show every 10 minutes for it to catch up. This stick would be good for a guest bedroom that doesn't get used daily. We have used a roku for years so I'm not dissing their company as a whole just the stick.
