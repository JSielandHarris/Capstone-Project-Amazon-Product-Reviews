"Everything I wanted the Fire TV Stick to be","I love the Chromecast and I have one installed on every TV in my home. Flawless casting YouTube, Netflix, Twitch, etc. I have a 60mb download internet connection and I have used Chromecast with both a wired (you need a separate adapter) and a wireless connection. You can find applications on Android that you can cast just about any video from the internet to a Chromecast. Now if only they would support Amazon Prime Video...EDIT: They've gone and done it, ladies and gentlemen! Google and Amazon have worked it out and now we can cast Prime Video to these devices! I'm in hog heaven!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2018","Dei Su",1
"Doesn't work the way you might think","The ad says ""Stream from your phone to your TV. Just like that."" Lots of articles tell you that the benefit of this over a fire stick is that you don't need an internet connection because you cast right from your phone. Sadly, these things are wrong, you need an internet connection at your house, so it's not like you can just cast from your phone with your unlimited data plan.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2018","Marlin Rich",1
"You can't use Chromecast without internet service and a router.","I get unlimited internet through my cell phone because I live outside of the city in a small town that doesn't have internet service. So I ordered this with the belief that I could mirror my phone to my TV by getting Chromecast which would be awesome because I could stream Netflix and Amazon straight to my TV... or so I thought. Turns out you cannot stream directly to a TV with Chromecast UNLESS you have internet AND a wi-fi router. This information came directly from Google Chromecast tech support. Why the hell Google would set this up like that I have no idea. Had I known this, I would never have wasted $35 on this device. So please be aware of these facts BEFORE you decide to invest your money in this thing.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2019","James Lockhart",1
"Be aware - useless in most hotel rooms","I travel quite a bit and bought Chromecast to be able to use hotel TVs instead of my small phone screen or tablet. Not so fast. At the very end of setup I got a message that Chromecast cannot communicate with my Android phone because of AP (Access Point) Client Isolation feature which prevents WIFI clients on the same router from communicating with each other. It is a security feature commonly used in hotels and other similar situations. Not Google's fault, but they should clearly warn about it as it is very common. Interestingly, in the initial setup Chromecast acts as its own access point and does not need another network, so they could do it differently... Returning it and will check Amazon Fire Stick which needs only one WIFI connection and communicates with its remote via Bluetooth","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2019","Kindle Customer",1
"I Wanted it to send movies, tv, video, etc to my big screen","I did not realize that the big three, google, apple, and amazon are locked in a death struggle for content and seem to make sure that whatever they control won't work on the other guys product.They all say you can use screen mirroring, but it I went through many you-tube videos and anything else I could find and the best I could do was to get it to work in reverse I could get the nice big picture on my 60 inch to show up on my iphone but not the other way,My suggestion is to decide what you want to watch, see who has a dedicated app for that and buy their device, hoping it will work and knowing it will probably be obsolete in a matter of months, of course if you want to watch something else, you might have to do it again.www this approach is expensive.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2019","Joan D.",1
"Overall pleased, you can stream everything from your smart phone","Fun to use but doesn’t stream Amazon Prime from Google Home app. If you download separate Chromecast streaming app you might be able to mirror cast from smartphone Prime Video app but haven’t been successful so far. So I still have Roku to stream Amazon Prime but Chromecast streams everything else.

"Delivers on promise, but not without some minor issues","Finally, can purchase Google products from the comfort of Amazon.As for device itself - it does, what it's intended for; used to have a first gen of Chromecast few years back - current gen. seems to be faster and more stable (used to get a lot of connection errors on previous genearation - have never seen anything like that on new gen.) One of small issues - I planned to cast the movie audio track to my speaker with built-in chromecast and video to my TV (with chromecast dongle connected to it), but it seems it's impossible by the means of Google home app - not a showstopper, but somewhat strange for a company, that tries to build streaming device infrastructure .","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2019","Alex",1
"Works flawlessy, faster than the old one","Product replaced my old chomecast which lacked a couple of features I needed. This one was just as easy to install (<5mins). Has worked perfectly ever since. Delivery was fast as promised. Product performs well and seems to be faster on my internet that the old chromecast - the old one occasionally interrupted & temporarily froze videos despite my 70/70 Mbps synchronous high speed connection. With this Chromecast that is not happening. Nice!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2019","sherbert",1
"It's the perfect device to stream everything from my phone to my TV","UPDATE: I now have an LG V40 ThinQ with Android 10.0 and the Chromecast is still great. I can send almost anything on my phone to the Chromecast and my TV. It is wonderful.I was looking for a way to send videos from my Android phone to my 2013 Samsung Smart TV. I use Netflix and my TV has an old, outdated version. I also use Prime Video and Kodi which my TV doesn't have. This Chromcast allows me to watch both of these and more on my TV. It was simple to install. I plugged it into my TV's HDMI socket and the power into my home's AC outlet. Then installed Google Home on my phone and followed the instructions. It took some fiddling with the programs but it works great. I read in one of the other reviews that it didn't work plugging the power cable into the TV's USB port. They were right and wrong. The Chromecast uses a 1 amp power supply. My TV has 2 USB ports; a 1 amp and a 0.5 amp. When I used the 1 amp port, it worked the same as plugging it in to an outlet. Now Netflix works simply as per the instructions. However, to get the others to work needs a little ingenuity. I have an HTC 10 phone, but this should work with others. I start Google Home first. Then go into my phone's settings to where the VPN and data exchange settings are. My phone calls the setting ""HTC Connect"". It tells the phone where to play the media. When you choose it, it lists the Phone, DNLA devices and the Chromecast. When you pick Chromecast, the phone's screen gets played, in real time, on the TV along with the phone. Now, anything you see on your phone gets played on your TV also. It's like using a phone with a 40 inch screen. Along with movies, you can stream music, photos, games, etc. I will be getting a new phone in a few days and will update these instructions when it arrives.UPDATE: I purchased a new LG V40 ThinQ cell phone. And it works with Chromecast just like my HTC phone did. You can stream with supported apps like Netflix or share using settings. The setting is under ""Connected Devices"". It is called ""Screen Sharing"" and Chromecast is listed like it was on my HTC. Obviously, I cannot promise that it will work with all phones, but it seems likely that it will.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2019","Dr. M. Helfand",1
"Must have","Works exactly the way you would expect. Much easier to set up than previous generations. Have used Chromecasts as my only tv for years. So easy even my mom and boyfriend's mom can use it.You need:-Your house needs WiFi.-You need a smart phone that is logged onto your wifi (doesn't have to have an active plan).-Your tv needs an available HDMI port.-You need to have (and pay for, if applicable) the apps you want to stream (Youtube, Netflix, Hulu, etc).-10 to 30 minutes of patience and two brain cells.Included:-You can use either a regular wall outlet or your tv's USB port for charging. COMES WITH the charging cable and USB to wall converter box (same as charging a phone).-The ability to cast a phone screen, a phone app, the computer screen, a computer app, a computer file or Power Point.-Step by step setup instructions on your tv screen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2019","BobTD",1
"Great for streaming content but needs a phone/computer/Google Home to work","Really easy to setup using the Google Home app. I have a Google Home mini(smart speaker) that works with this device and allows you to play and pause just by speaking, which is really nice.I like the idea of the Google Chromecast. I think it's a neat idea and it is really reliable (more so than Amazon fire TV). As long as you understand that this IS NOT a standalone device, you should be happy with it. The way it works is-you use your iOS or Android device with a compatible app (look for the cast icon), establish a connection, and then you use your phone as a remote. The Chromecast has no user interface to speak of. You pick what content you want on another device and then cast to the Chromecast. If you are watching a tv series on Netflix for instance, when the episode you are watching finishes, the next one will automatically play. You can also cast from the Chrome web browser which will let you access things like Prime Video which doesn't have casting capabilities in the mobile app. I would recommend using an app over the browser when you can, because it's a smoother experience.There are a few extras like being able to mirror the screen from your mobile device to your tv, if that is something you have a need for. You can also view your google photos in a slideshow while the chromecast is inactive. You can do this in the settings for the chromecast in the google home app. I think this is worth $35, and I would recommend it if you can deal with a slightly less conventional TV/Movie watching experience. After using this a while, I prefer it to an android tv or roku type of OS. I just think they should beef up the Google Assistant features( more like Android TV).Edit: In the time since my original review, Amazon prime video now allows for casting from the iOS and Android mobile apps. Amazon and Google are on better terms now and as a result the fire tv and echo shows now have the YouTube app again and Amazon is selling Google hardware on this site again too. Just wanted to update my review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2019","Solid Snake",2
"Total Garbage","I had high hopes, only to have them dashed by a crappy product. Immediately upon plug-in, it took about 10 minutes to ""load"" new software updates, restarting several times. Seriously, brand new product, needs 10 minutes of updates on first plug-in? Then Google wants the Home app on your phone. Ok, load that. Then you need to go through all sorts of really invasive questions and setup that Google says will give a ""better experience"". B.S. Google only wants info from to you maximize their profit. lastly, there is no real content on the device itself. Just casting from the phone or tablet. And not from every app, just ones that are casting-enabled.I was VERY disappointed. ROKU or Amazon Fire Stick is WAYYYY better. Don't waste your time with this JUNK.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2019","dgal1234",2
"The best bang for your buck!!!","I am absolutely delighted with my Google Chromecast (3rd Generation)!Set up is a breeze and very user-friendly. Simply hook up the Google Chromecast (3rd Generation) to your TV and follow the simple install instructions. Then download the app to your phone such as Netflix, Disney +, Amazon Prime Video, etc. ... open the app on your phone ... select the video that you want to watch ... cast it to your TV ... and just sit back and enjoy! Your phone is your remote so you'll want to keep a phone charger nearby.Nothing has to be cracked, hacked, or unlocked. Everything streams from your phone to the TV via your Wi-Fi. It works seamlessly with both iPhone and Android. The resolution is crystal, life like, clear.

"Did more then I thought!","I am not a tech person at all nor do I live in the best area for tech things to work! For starters I ordered a subscription thinking it would work on my tv. In thinking it was a smart tv in all it would work right?? Wrong of course! Well after contacting them I found out about the Google Chromecast and how it will solve my problem. Well after a few failed attempts (which I might add again I am not tech smart) I was able to get everything set up right through my phone and was pretty pleased with myself in doing so. What was really cool was not only was I able to get the subscription, I was able to do a few other things on my tv like add pictures to my screen and a whole bunch of other stuff that I have not even heard of lol. The picture quality is really good. However i still do live in an area that my wifi sucks and this runs of that. So I do get a few pauses during movies and such. Nothing new I dont deal with watching other streaming channels. Still hoping one day with all this tech stuff they can help people like me who dont live in the city!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2020","Diana L.",2
"The Chromecast is part of my life now....","My god... This is so amazing... I love that stupid little puck.Originally I was going to buy an Amazon Firestick buuuut sorry Amazon, Google is connected to everything what did you expect me to do. Don't get me wrong I still own 2 other sticks for my parent's TVs in their bedroom and living room and its very easy to use simply by the use of the remote.Buuuuuut, THE CHROMECAST HAS NO LIMIT. There are TOO many apps you can connect with the casting tech. Its easy to cast, fast, and even better in video quality when compared to your phone. Sometimes a video doesn't immediately load 720p or 1080p on your phone but it's immediately HD when cast. You can turn off your phone and still see whatever you casted last. You can even connect to your TV remote so you can pause and stop casting with your TV remote. Also, that screen mirroring comes in handy every now and then!Honestly I even leave in the ambient mode just for decoration. It's AMAZING. I can watch and cast apps not on my old blue ray not my ps4 or even the Firestick. Switching from Hulu to Netflix to SlingTV to YouTube is INSTANT. No interruptions, very rare buffering and loading is quick with average internet speed. Honestly I really do reccomend this more than the Amazon Firestick. Sorry Amazon, step it up. They BARELY added YouTube as an app on the stick! Here you can even cast your computer screen on the TV! I can't reccomend it enough. Tip: don't buy the 4k version if you dont have a 4k TV.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2019","Dan",2
"Remote control is STILL a disaster.","On the positive side, Google has come a long way improving the utterly disgraceful 1st Generation Chromecast's ease of installation. On the downside, they have failed miserably in remote-control (at least where YouTube TV is concerned) of content with your phone. And bear in mind, I have a GOOGLE PHONE.Two infuriating problems:1) The connection between phone and Chromecast fails within minutes of hitting Play --- and the only way you can regain control of your programming is to turn-off YouTube TV (sometimes MULTIPLE times), then HOPE you can regain control. But when you do that, you'll probably lose your place in the program you're watching.2) The FF and Rewind options are uttterly PATHETIC. You either have a 15-sec forward or back option --- both of which respond excrutiatingly slowly --- or you use the slider at the bottom of the screen. And don't even get me started on all the problems that causes --- like, again, total loss of remote control.ALL THAT SAID, if you have a Smart TV, your remote will probably control YouTube TV --- which, apart from the problems mentioned above --- is, in IMO, the best Programming Delivery platform I've ever experienced, including cable and satellite.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2019","francis hare",2
"Works well with Xfinity mobile app","There is a lot of software that claims to screencast to an inexpensive TV. Skip them. We wanted to stream as much programming and DVR content to a TV when we are away from our house. Xfinity limits the live broadcasts you can stream. It seems that any programming that you finished recording can be streamed with your mobile app. If Xfinity won’t let you stream it, record it then strean the completed recording. This dongle is very easy to setup using the Google Home App. If your TV has an unused HDMI port the dongle will work for you. You do need good internet service in the area near your TV. There are plenty of youtube videos explaining Chromecasting. Once you have located the Cast button in the Xfinity App, using it is intuitive. There is very little buffering or delay and no problems with picture and voice synch. Youtube streams well using the youtube app. Haven’t yet learned to do general screen mirroring. Suspect I need another app for that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2021","Stephen Burkhardt",2
"Solved a casting issue perfectly","After cutting the cable I made the Amazon Firestick my streaming device of choice, but casting from my (android) phone never worked- the time to loss of signal was at best a few minutes and very frustrating. Because much of my favorite viewing arrives by phone I finally turned to the cheapest version of the Chromecast as an alternative to the firestick. It does not store apps but it works brilliantly for simply sending my phone screen to the TV. There is never a hiccup in the signal transmission and the video quality is excellent. For this limited purpose you can also use a VPN on your phone if you wish, it does not impede the signal at all. The setup is fairly easy and it has improved my viewing experience enormously. (The built-in screensaver is great too!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2022","Robert H. Buckley",2
"IT LET ME WATCH DISNEY+ ON MY OLD VIZIO TV!!!! I DID IT ALL FOR BABY YODA!!","I was VERY frustrated by trying to add the Disney+ app to my 5-year-old Vizio flat-screen TV. I have an iPhone and I have Wi-Fi and I pay my bills and it shouldn't be this hard to add a channel or app to my TV!! I could download the Disney+ app to my iPhone, but I couldn't get it to ""cast"" or ""mirror cast"" to my Vizio TV like so many help sites were suggesting. I was seriously thinking I needed to go buy a new TV (ugh) when I saw the Google Chromecast (3rd Generation) on Amazon and it SPECIFICALLY said it would work with the Disney+ app. So I bought it! After reading the instructions (this Chromecast doohickey plugs into an HDMI port on my TV *AND* you have to use the provided electrical cord to ALSO plug it into an outlet at the same time. This is different than the old metal Chromecast I had-and of course lost- years ago.) Then you must download the ""Google Home"" app on your smart phone and set up your TV from the app. You must have Wi-Fi access, and both your smart phone and your TV must be using the same Wi-Fi. No problem! Then it was easy to ""cast"" the Disney+ channel from my smart phone to my TV, and now I am very happy watching ""The Mandalorian"" and baby yoda on a proper large-screen TV. Thank you, Google and Amazon! This was much cheaper than buying a new TV.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2020","Jillie Pintuck, Ph.D.",2
"Set Up in Seconds! Works on Old Projector!","Purchased for an old school epson moviemate projector so I could stream movies from my iPhone to watch in our backyard. My biggest concern with other adapters were restrictions in streaming Netflix or Disney+, after researching this looked to be the best option. Set up is super easy, use the google home app and you’re up and running in no time. It plugs in through hdmi and powers through a usb wall outlet, I was able to power mine directly from the built in usb in the projector. Honestly couldn’t be happier. I only wish there was an option to share my iPhone screen rather than just certain apps, but this works for what we need; a quick seamless solution to watch movies in the backyard without adding too much clutter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2020","Jim",2
"These are excellent for giving you an additional computer monitor","Want to use an additional monitor on your computer, but your computer doesn't support an additional monitor? Under the following limited circumstances, you can cast a browser tab to another monitor using this Chromecast:1. The other monitor must support HDMI inputs (so the Chromecast can connect).2. Currently only works with the Google Chrome & Microsoft Edge browsers.3. Once you cast a browser tab to the other monitor, you can minimize the original tab on your computer, giving you screen space. However, in order to interact with the screen on the other monitor, you must un-minimize the original tab & interact there.However, if you just want to start watching a video on the other monitor, this works perfectly.I have eight of these, & they work great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2021","Dean K.

"Works great for streaming from Phones and tablets to your TV.","This Device works great and easily with most applications on my Motorola Smartphone. Some streaming programs like Netflix and Disney+ or similar will have issues on some shows/movies and it take longer than normal to cast it to the TV. Overall, I would still purchase this device for its ease of use.I did have an issue when installing the first one on the living room TV. During Setup, the Chromecast required an update and once completed, lost contact to the device used to set it up. The Chromecast showed it was fully setup on the TV but was not detectable by any device that would normally cast to it. Restarts did not work. I had to do a hard reset and redo the Chromecast setup. Now it works great with no issue.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2021","Donald Kyte",3

Recently I moved to a home with a smartv and honestly I still prefer chromecast and would use it in the smartv. Why? because you can use your cell phone, that is always in your hand, to control it.

"Improves on older models","The first two generations of the Chromecast had issues with getting too hot, dropping the stream, freezing, etc. This one seems to have fixed those problems. It's warm to the touch when in use, but no more so than any other electronic device (i.e. Roku, Android phone, etc.) would be. it casts/mirrors exactly what is on the original source.Chromecasts don't come with a physical remote; it's simply an intermediary device to translate what you're casting to a format your TV understands. Control of the picture and sound are done by the user on the input device or the end device (i.e. a TV, via its remote).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2021","Tom Barrister",3

The Firestick I have requires an outlet. This is also much snappier and responsive than a Firestick. I've used Chrome on my PC to stream to the device (there is about a 1.5s delay) as well as my phone. Quality is great (but the PC will suffer performance. I've got an insane build with a Ryzen 3900x - there are some hiccups inside Windows itself, not the device's fault. Windows doesn't really like streaming via a browser).Anyway, great device.

"Great for streaming; color - meh","This streams all of my subscription services as well as content from my iPhone almost perfectly. The only issue I have with it (and another identical model I bought directly from Google that is on another TV) is the color isn't as vivid as my other streaming capable devices. The reds in the YouTube logo and videos are more dull, more brown color on both devices/TVs compared to my older PS3 and Apple TV units. I can get used to it, but I still use my PS3 for DVD and Blueray, and still use both TVs for over the air broadcasts where the color is fine, so I don't want to go messing around with picture settings. The settings on the Chromecast don't address the issue, but it's not that horrible and I'll get used to it.

I've cast several things onto it to test it out including music and TV shows and it works perfectly fine.

I was sick of it, plain and simple. So I decided to get Google Chromecast and I'm very happy I did. It's super easy to set up with your network and phone. I like that you can cast pretty much whatever you want using your phone or computer as your source and remote. I couldn't be happier, and I liked it so much, I purchased a second one for my projector in my movie room. Perfect clarity, not glitches and works wonderfully. You can't go wrong with it.

The device is small and neat. I decided to go with the Chromecast based on research done over several weeks and I had high expectations. However, I observed that it wasn't exactly as anticipated. During several different operations such as mirroring, the response was a bit sluggish and the biggest issue of all is it keeps disconnecting and becomes non-responsive, which forced me to do a reboot. Though that was done, I still experienced the issues. Honestly, it's a nice little device, but there are clearly some issues.It is important to note that during the initial setup the device did perform a automatic update, i would assume that this would correct any possible bugs. Not sure if my device may just be a bad on, but I will watch and see over the next few days, before I draw my conclusion.I will give it some time and test for the next 30 days at which point I will provide an update on my experiences. I would appreciate a feedback from Google as to the reason(s) for the issues.Update: Have been using the device for a few weeks now. However, it has not lived up to my expectations. The main issue is the device keeps losing connection and tends to reboot itself. These actions constantly disrupt my viewing pleasure and as such I am not able to truly enjoy watching movies. As such I have downgraded my rating from 3 stars to 1 star. I strongly believe a refund is in order.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2020","SSS",4
"Very nice and useful, especially if your TV lacks wifi","This is very useful, so glad I bought it for my TV. I thought it would have a standalone interface (apps and stuff) and it does not, it's just used for casting. This is not negative, just something to point out.My Samsung TVs wireless capabilities stopped working but now I can still stream using the Chromecast. Having Google Assistant is also a plus as you can control volume and TV power if your TV supports HDMI control.I'd say the most important thing to keep in mind is that it doesn't have a stand alone interface like a fire stick for example, instead, your phone and it's apps is the interface.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2020","Honest Reviews",4
"Great device","I am impressed with google Chromecast. You can literally project your whole desktop from both windows and mac by choosing to cast feature and selecting the desktop from chrome browser. You can also project an individual tab or file. While casting tab, you can also transfer sound for both mac and windows. While casting desktop, windows transfers sound also but mac does not. So the sound comes from the computer. It naturally works for Chromebooks perfectly for both picture and sound. Don't waste your money on cheap dongles that they promise to work with Miracast and airplay. They are all terrible. From your mobile device, you can cast most applications.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2019","A. Doyuran",4

"You need to have Chrome installed in order to Stream to your TV","The volume control is a little wanky, use your phone as the remote control. You can't just stream games, videos, and other files that you may have on your computer, but instead have to use Chrome, enable streaming, after setting up the Chromecast which must be networked onto the same WiFi as your computer (home network). It's good for watching YouTube, Hulu, Netflix, Disney+, Prime videos if you don't have a smart TV, or your provider doesn't supply the app, mine does except for Disney+. which is probably proprietary anyway.

"Recommendation to Setup and learn how it works.","I am an Apple user but not all Apple users use Apple products. I use an average laptop of mine to cast it and it works perfectly fine when it comes to Netflix. The only tricky part is casting it on websites like Kissanime or sites to watch free shows. Don’t worry, all you have to do is redo what you did, if method doesn’t work then do it differently or refresh it. That’s how I figure things out, test it, double check and try other methods. Since I am always using technology then it’s partially self explanatory. If you’re a elderly but have knowledge then follow the steps on the instructions you got first. Next go to the website from what the instructions said. Then follow the steps of what you see on the website to guide you through. Lastly, test it out, see what works or doesn’t work so you know what to do.

"Once you know how...","Had to update my review since I finally figured out how to set the thing up! NOTE: the app DOES NOT serve a purpose when it comes to casting... If you're on your phone, open the app you want to cast and select the button to cast it. If you are trying to cast your laptop, maybe sure you're on the same wifi network as the device. Once those things are aligned, you should be good to go. Pretty simple once you know.

"If Your On A Budget Get This! If You Can Afford More, Buy The Ultra!","I truly have mixed feelings about this device...These new notebooks and tablets, are made with such a thin bezel design, that they engineer themselves out from having any HDMI ports! We live in a new age of wireless, I guess everybody hates cords now days. This forces us to buy products like this one, so that we can screencast. Again, tell me whats so wrong with an HDMI cable? My old tablet had one, worked fine, is wireless casting really that much better? Lets find out!So I got a new Dragon Touch Max 10 tablet, naturally it don't come with an HDMI port, figures. So I hooked up this Google Chromecast device to my 1080P IPS 24"" monitor. The device tells you on screen to download the Google Home app on your device and to follow the instructions to set it up. While it was technically easy to setup, following the instructions, the process took way longer then I expected.If you took one look at that little device, you would think its not a computer, but you would be wrong. There is a little computer in there, and what is a common thing that all computers like to do? Thats right, install updates. So guess why the process took twice as long as it should? Yep, cause it needed updated. So once that was all done, took me a little bit to learn how to screencast this thing.I was able to screencast Youtube, and Netflix with much success, it loads up to full resolution on screen, looks awesome on my IPS display! Occasionally however, I would notice a slight framerate issue from time to time. More on that later. And then I went into the Google Home app in order to mirror cast my tablet so that everything casts. Well, there is first real bit where I am disappointed.When mirror casting, it does not fill up my 1080P monitor. Its more then likely serving the tablet display's resolution, which is a 1920 *1200 16/10 ratio. Using Droid Info, I discovered the tablet is operating at a refresh rate of 48-herts frequency for display, instead of the typical 60-herts that is used in the US. Since there is no display options to change for screen casting resolutions and refresh rate, I am not able to fix that issue.When playing games, I noticed that the occasional framerate issue I talked about, became total lag, and the bitrate dropped terribly, but this was not the Chromcast devices fault. Turns out, this was my tablets fault! I was connected to my WIFI using the 2.4GHZ frequency, the best signal performance I was getting about 8 feet from my router in direct line of sight, was -30DB. Turns out, that is not enough performance to screencast properly!The good news however, is my tablet is also capable of connecting to my routers 5GHZ protocal. What a game changer that was, switching over to 5GHZ! All the sudden my tablets WIFI performance increased exponentially, and my WIFI performance went off the scale. As soon as I switched over to 5GHZ, all the sudden the Chromecast device was operating better with smooth as glass framerate in video casting, and smoother framerate in gaming as well.The amount of horse power in your device matters too. The more better your mobile device can perform, the better the Chromecast will perform. My new tablet runs a 1.6GHZ Octa core CPU with 3GB RAM, so its no slouch. However, higher end Samsung models and Apple model devices, will more then likely perform better with the Chromecast device, due to more horse power in performance, and in higher resolution and refresh rates.When your not screen casting to the Chromecast, then the Chromecast goes into slideshow mode, where it rotates to images from Google, at a time interval that you can set. And without a doubt, I have seen some of the most incredible images displayed, over the Google Chromecast, as a standbye screensaver solution! However, another bad thing about this device, is it will restart without warning, by its own choosing, for reasons unknown.I figured that I would spend less money and get the 3rd generation model, as the monitor is only 1080P to begin with. But, I can't help but to think, that I would have probably gotten a better experience with screencasting, if I had bought the Ultra model, even though my screen is not 4K. If your on a budget, this 3rd generation model is most certainly an option. However, if you can afford to spend more, go for the Ultra.The Chromecast device also gets very warm, even when not actively screencasting. If your not interested in the slideshow standbye mode when not in use, I would just disconnect the power to the device, to save on your power bill. Also, if your device has less then my devices SPECS for performance, you can forget about wireless screencasting. But you will be better off with a device that exceeds mines SPECS. 4 out of 5 stars!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2020","Arthur Senior",7

As silly as it sounds, being able to control my tv streams from my phone or by voice with Google home is a game changer. Just that much more convenient. Also, I’ve said “Hey Google, play ‘random movie name’” and the chrome cast will start playing a movie on whatever service has it available. Pretty awesome!

One must have another device with the apps, or programs installed on the other device. Hit the TV looking button on top of the app or program and viola! Your casting (streaming) to your TV. It’s decadent, it’s the future. It’s only drawback is the restrictions that technology or the programs that YOU don’t allow or allow to be casted. Be carful as casting and or streaming (Depends on what side of the tracks you were born on or currently live) is highly addictive. Some side effects are sore thumbs, getting closer to your loved one(s). Moderation is key unless binge watching is your thing.Easy to install - plug into an empty HDMI port, connect to WiFi, get comfortable with your significant other and or other family member(s), and your done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2019","Prochauffeur",17

"Useless garbage","I have a 1st generation chromecast from FIVE years ago and it works just fine. Maybe a little slow at times, but not a big deal.Even though I have Fire TV I couldn't wait on cutting the cord for YouTubeTV and had to get a second chromecast for a different tv. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.At least once a day I get disconnected in the middle of watching YouTubeTV. I can see Chromecast on my television but it doesn't appear on my phone or PC even though we are on the same WiFi network. This happens constantly and I have to reset (unplug/wait 2 mins/plug back in) allllllll the time. As I type this I am casting video only. No audio. Which is what drove me to return here and finally leave a review. I had been putting it off in hopes that it would get it together, but things have only gotten worse.This thing is a joke. And their suggestions on how to troubleshoot are just as laughable. Yes, my phone, pc and chromecast are all on the same network. No, it isn't my router as EVERYTHING else is working just fine. It's YOU, chromecast.I hate you.Please, Amazon - if you're listening (and I know you are) - acquire access for YouTubeTV already.

"This is incredible","You can stream almost any subscription streaming service on here and also can CAST YOUR PC'S SCREEN ON THE TV!!! Stream quality is spot on!Now for the FAQs:You need the Google Home application on a MOBILE DEVICE to setup the Chromecast (you cannot get Google Home on your PC) and wifi needs to be enabled + connected on the mobile device.Once the chromecast is setup, the mobile device and others will be able to detect the chromecast device afterwards.Just note:If you are using a streaming service like YouTube, Amazon Prime, etc. Streaming services consume data because the videos are downloading as you play them.Casting a movie or video that is already downloaded on your phone or PC does not consume data because the video is already downloaded.If you want to stream a video from a subscription app such as Amazon Prime, Pluto TV, or YouTube... You have to go INTO those apps to ""cast"" the videos. NOT from the Google Home app. Those apps will not appear inside the Google Home app and they don't need to.This also applies for PC casting.For the PC, the simplest way to cast is to open up a chrome browser, click on the vertical three dots ""..."" on the top right of the window, and then chose ""Cast...""From there it should pull up the chromecast device and should also give the option to choose to either cast a... file, the desktop, or a specific screen.I highly recommend this if you need a way to project movies on your PC on a TV.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2021","Alissa",39

"No better than 1st Gen","I recently tried to use Chromecast again, having laid aside mine since I bought Amazon Fire Sticks.But there was some content on my phone not available on the Stick that I wanted to cast on my TV.The whole setup process has changed. Now there is a Google Home app that walks you through it.Long story short: could not get my old dongle to work consistently. Bought this 3rd Gen dongle. Same problems. Sometimes it worked. Most of the time it did not, even with the help of Chromecast customer support.I do not have patience with iffy products. I sent it back. I am not in the market for problems.I picked the old dongle out of the trash. Some day when I am feeling really relaxed, I may try it again.Thank God for the Fire Stick. Not one problem. Ever.

"Needs a home internet connection to work, but there's a workaround.","When you lose your internet connection this device instantly becomes useless. However, there is a workaround that I found by accident. When you lose your home internet connection, turn on your phone's hotspot and name the hotspot the same thing as your home wifi. Chromecast will then try to use your hotspot instead and will connect to the internet via your phone. You can then use casting apps like YouTube, etc. to cast to the Chromecast.

It does connect, but the phone can't find it. (Yes, the phone and Chromecast are on the same network).... and the AP isolation is off and UPNP is on.It just doesn't work. When it does, you've basically opened up your network to everyone and his hacker brother, but that's not a problem for Alphabet.

"Does not satisfy my travel use case","My older phones had easy ways to connect video output to HDMI, and then to a large TV screen. My current phone does not support MHL output, and does not have a micro HDMI port, so Chromecast is the ONLY way to display the screen contents of my phone on an alternate screen according to manufacturer's support. And, even then, screen display options are limited to compatible apps. Many newer phones have the same issue, so it seems like phones have regressed in the area of video output rather than progressed.My use case for Chromecast is for travel: I want to display my phone’s screen on a large hotel TV just like my older phones were capable of doing. For example, I want to play downloaded Google Play movies and/or Netflix content on a hotel TV. At home, I use Fire TV sticks since those are standalone devices and a Chromecast at home does not have comparable ease of use since it does not include a remote.Chromecast turns out to be a dead end as an MHL/direct cable replacement because it has the fatal flaw of requiring an Internet connection to display Google Play movies on an alternate screen. Since hotel Internet connections require some browser interaction for each device, you cannot setup Chromecast to use hotel provided Internet.There is a successful way to use two personal devices to setup Chromecast by using your phone as a mobile hotspot, and then connecting the other device to the hotspot and using that to setup Chromecast. After setup, you can access Chromecast via the hotspot phone only and successfully output video to any alternate screen with HDMI input. Unfortunately, that does not meet my use case because Chromecast in this configuration consumes limited data classified as “mobile hotspot:” it’s not simply the Phone’s video output from an unlimited data plan. Chromecast also, and astonishingly, ignores an already downloaded Google Play movie and streams it again using the limited hotspot data, so pre-downloading is not a viable workaround.Using a local Wifi router in a hotel also fails: you can do Chromecast setup, but media features such as Google Play movies, even those already fully downloaded, will not play since the local router does not have an Internet connection.I often carry a Chromebook with HDMI out with me while traveling, and Google Play does allow movie downloads on that so you can download movies in advance using the lower “free” tier of hotel wifi rather than rely on hotel low tier direct streaming only. A Chromebook, although more expensive, succeeds at being a much more useful media casting device to a hotel TV than Chromecast. I will be returning the Chromecast since it does little more than waste my time.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2019","AnikaGSD",105
"Doesn't work reliably mirroring phones;Mirrors Chrome browser on laptops;Full circle of disappointme","(written by husband of account holder) Didn't like the way that only a single wi-fi network is saved on the device at a time. After my wife was able to easily use the Chromecast successfully at home to stream a movie from a laptop I tried to use it at church to mirror my phone, a Pixel 4XL. This required resetting the device(as I was not at home when I wanted to reconfigure it) to recognize a wireless network at church. Then things got worse - the device doesn't seem to work on wireless networks with a captive portal.So... I borrowed my wife's phone(a Pixel 4a) to create a Wi-Fi hotspot(the plan was to mirror from my own Pixel 4XL) and was able to reconfigure the Chromecast to work on the hotspot. Good to go, right?At that point I was able to successfully change the screensaver images to a gallery on my phone. Looking good at this point, it seems.Sunday school class starts and I connect to the Chromecast(yay!) and try to start the mirroring... and nothing. No error message. Phone indicates the Chromecast is connected so I try again - nothing appears on the large display the HDMI is plugged into other than the screensaver that was earlier configured.I disconnect my phone from the Chromecast, reconnect to the Chromecast, and attempt to mirror my phone's display again. Nothing - just the screensaver. At this point I revert to using the chalkboard and pen and paper to facilitate the class discussion.Ultimately a disappointment, made even worse by the fact that previously at home I was able to successfully mirror my Pixel 4XL to our TV there. I'm sure there are troubleshooting steps I overlooked, but I just wanted this thing to quickly and easily work and felt that it would work great since I was using all Google branded products. Not so. Was about to return it but my wife suggested to use the laptop instead next time. I guess that'll work. Then again, so would running an HDMI cord straight from the laptop, or buying an HDMI wireless transmitter - wait, wasn't that essentially why I bought the Chromecast in the first place? <U+0001F61E>","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2021","Rasfam",105

"ChromeCAST Casting is a nightmare.","I bought this with intentions of replacing the need for my long and winding HDMI cable, which I feed from my desktop computer to my television on the other side of the room. Essentially, I pull up various streaming services on the computer and then watch them on the TV, but in order to pause, rewind, or change videos, I have to get up and sit at the computer for a bit. It's a pain in the butt, however it's worked for me flawlessly for well over a year now. I had hoped to be able to cast TV, music, and videos from other devices (phone, laptop, tablet) to the Google Chromecast and save myself a few steps back and forth.Unfortunately, my only truly compatible device is my Android phone which, due to storage space issues I use for nothing, so the control features built into this product are useless to me, and I don't have any other Google Home products so being able to call out voice controls isn't something I can benefit from either. When screen-mirroring and casting from my other devices (which was my primary goal anyway), the connection is absolute garbage. The video itself comes through in oddly poor quality, the audio is choppy and robotic, and the stream often lags despite having excellent high-speed internet in my home. I'm returning this thing, and will try an Amazon firestick instead. At least it comes with a real remote.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2020","Amazon Customer",109

"Chromecast - A Must-Have for Travel","I've used an earlier version of the Chromecast for years. It still works well. I also have the newer 3rd generation, and it works great.I love bringing Chromecasts when I travel. It's great to be able to watch the Apps that I want on (almost) any TV that I want. I've used Chromecasts when I traveled to other countries, and it's a great way to share photos, videos and music from my phone/tablet while visiting family/friends. I've also gifted Chromecasts with friends/family I've stayed with by installing it on their TV for them. It works well, as long as they have a free HDMI port on their TV and a USB power source. (It uses a Micro USB port for power.) They're usually amazed that they can now watch YouTube on their TV.Chromecasts, I've found, may be available in other countries, but they are often more expensive and not as widely used. I always bring at least one with me. For me, it's a must-have item for travel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2020","Pandy",109

"Can even be used with your cellular hotspot","I don't have an internet connection where I live yet I stream music, Prime Video, Hulu live, and Netflix on my HDTV using the Chromecast device. This is a great tool in your arsenal for cord cutting. I have 40Gigs of 4GLte hotspot a month between two smartphones and this is enough for me to stream and binge watch while at home or away.1) Simply download the Google Home app from the Google play store to any android device (I've used this app on my android tablets and phones with hotspots. My tablet only has a 3GLte hotspot and that's ok for streaming music but too sluggish for streaming high quality video). You use the Home app on the device to set up and name the Chromecast device (ex: ChromeLvRm, ChromeMBR, etc). This name is what shows up as attached to your wifi hotspot whenever you turn the hotspot on while in range of the Chromecast. This setup is a one time thing per Chromecast device. Once it's set up, you are good to go.2) use your tv remote control to switch your input to what ever HDMI you have attached the Chromecast to.3) (Unlike the Amazon firetv, Chromecast has no apps. The apps are on the device you cast from to the Chromecast device.) Then you use your device to play your streaming app (Hulu, Netflix, etc). When the video starts, you will see the casting symbol in the upper right corner of the video. Press this and you're casting to your Chromecast/HDTV. You use your device to pause, play, control volume, end casting, etc. Your device acts like the remote control.So to recap: you only need three things, your HDTV with HDMI connection, your device with the Google Home and streaming apps you've obtained from the Google play store, and your mobile hotspot...","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2019","RealBebopMusic",117

"Does not do what I expected","Don' waste your time and money on this product. I bought this with the understanding that it lets me cast ""any media"" from any app on my iPhone -- especially from within Safari or Google Chrome browser apps -- to my TV. I found in great disappointment that this product can NOT do that! All it can do is let you cast media from a specific ""limited"" number of channels, like Hulu, YouTube, Netflix, and a few others to your TV. But I could already access those channels and many more directly from my Roku streaming device beautifully. Talking to the ChromeCast Tech. Support, I found that the only way one can cast media from Safari/Chrome to a TV via the Chromecast is by buying one of several 3rd-party apps. I gave that a try, but those apps (at least the free version) bombarded me with pop-ups and long commercials, and then cast media at low resolution with lots of buffering stops along the way. Absolutely horrible! I wiped those apps from my iPhone and returned the ChromeCast the next day.Doing a little research online, I found that my wonderful Roku streaming device can elegantly link to the built-in AirPlay on my iPhone and iPad to ""mirror"" anything on the phone's display to the TV set. Bingo! That is exactly what I needed. Now, if you have an Android smart phone or tablet, things might work a little better for you (?).","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2021","Brisk2000",118

"Offers no advantage over using an old laptop as streamer; my TV already accepted Mirroring","The Chromecast works as described. I was expecting more; I should have researched the product more completely. I've been using an old lap top as a streamer for the last few years. It's plugged into the HDMI of our 2013-era smart TV. It works fine for streaming Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, etc. I've gotten frustrated with the slowness of the lap top's start up and it's Blue Tooth connectivity seems hit or miss - we control it via a Blue Tooth keyboard and mouse that reside on the couch. Time to up date, I figured. I thought the ChromeCast would provide a more seemless way to stream those services. It's really not. Operating the ChromeCast is more fiddly than I'd hoped. And it essentially has you mirroring your smartphone or tablet to the TV screen via the ChromeCast. I can already mirror the screen of my smart phone or tablet from those three streaming services to the TV w/out the ChromeCast. It's also kind of fiddly. Both that method and the ChromeCast seemed less/not more convenient than using the old slow-starting laptop. So, there you have it. Old slow-starting laptop is a better solution for us. I can see the ChromeCast being perfect for someone with a TV that doesn't accept mirroring. And it was only $19.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2021","MPC",118

"Good for batting practice, and that's it.","I bought this because I was watching more and more youtube at home but didn't want to deal with a smart tv interface. My mistake.Right out of the box this thing was finicky. I had multiple instances where when I tried to cast, the chromecast wouldn't be findable, and I then had to factory reset the whole thing. Even then, often the setup wizard would then inform me that I wasn't on the same wifi and I would then have to repeat. Google's customer service for this item is near worthless. Finally this morning I had had enough - I have thirty minutes I could be watching something, thing won't connect. Fine. Factory reset? Nope, didn't take bub, better do it again. After about five minutes of this thing wasting more of my time, I took it out back for some batting practice. Swing one, strike. Swing two, strike. Swing three - home run! And I say this with complete sincerity, watching that busted piece of junk fly over my fence and away is the only enjoyment I ever received.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2020","Knucklehead211",120

"Solves problem of HBO Max streaming on Samsung TV","I signed up for HBO Max because the introductory price was cheaper than streaming HBO through Amazon Prime, as I have been for years. I have a fairly new Samsung TV and expected to upgrade the HBO Now app to Max. Alas, only certain Samsung TVs have the Max app available. So what to do? I decided to try Chromecast and it works like a charm, streaming HBO Max content from an iPad to the TV. The quality is excellent, and it was easy to set up. I can even pause and resume the HBO streaming with the TV remote. Very pleased with this device!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2020","Mahj newbie",120

"Almost useless","While this device does the one thing it does okay, that one thing isn't worth much. It streams from your phone to your tv and really nothing else. The picture quality is good, but the sound is horrible, and you cannot control anything from the tv. And for what it does, there really isn't much use: I can stream all the services listed on the box (youtube, netflix, prime, etc.) with my tv with much better results and some actual control, so why would I bother projecting my phone to the tv? I bought it because I was trying to find a way to stream my video library from my pc (I've had inconsistent results with other methods), but despite the online sources that say otherwise, it doesn't do that. It only streams the chrome browser to the tv, which I don't have any use for. I suppose I could rig up chrome to play the videos somehow, but again I would have to control it from my pc, eliminating the usefulness of the device for that purpose.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2022","Mort Payne",122

"Why does it turn off out of nowhere??","I hate this chromecast. I not sure if amazon is upset about people shopping on their app and not buying a fire stick instead of chromecast. Because the chromecast that I bought years ago from here worked awesome, but this one sucks. The problem I have with it is out of no where it will shut off and and start all over. This usually happens whenever I load something on to the screen with my phone and then quickly exit out of the app I was using before giving it time to load. I feel like this shouldn’t be a problem because with all my other chromecast products I don’t this problem. It is so annoying imagine watching a YouTube video and the whole tv just going blank out of no where because the chromecast turned off, so now you have to stop everything you are doing and reconnect your phone to the chromecast to get it going.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2019","Benita Jones",122

"Very reliable, great device","Use it solely to stream movies and such from my phone. Originally was using the screen beam mini 2 but find the Google Chromecast more dependable. Have sound/audio issues with the other device that seems to occur because it is very hot to the touch after a short period of time when in use. Went through 4 replacements and all had that issue. The Google Chromecast, no such issue. Had to replace one chromecast after about 6 months, it kept dropping the connection for no reason.I do find the screenbeam setup a lot easier than the Google Chromecast. With the Screenbeam at a hotel there was no special setup required, just plug in the hdmi port and begin streaming. I haven't figured out the Google chromecast setup outside the home yet, it seems to want you to load something when in a different location. That's a slight negative for me. Will probably call support one day. Also, with Google chromecast some streaming services don't show the movie playing on your phone and TV together. It's a little inconvenient when you want to pause, FF or rewind. That was never the case with the screenbeam. Finally, the replacement of one Google chromecast to another requires a complete separate setup and naming convention. Find that a bit bothersome. Not the case with the screenbeam.All in all, for Quality and Reliability I love, love, love the Google chromecast device.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2021","Christian",126

"Important to Know the Difference Between Casting and Mirroring","I thought I could get away with using this to play downloaded Netflix content from my phone to the tv without an internet connection. You need an internet connection for this to work, however, and this is where the product description is misleading. They say that you need a wifi network for this to work, but they need to say that you need a wifi network that is connected to the internet. Two different things. This is a casting device, which means it uses the internet to look up and stream content that your phone directs it to. It does not take the content from your phone and put it on the screen. Hopefully this can help someone with similar desires and circumstances to not waste $30.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2022","Daniel",127

Sound transmission is 1-2 seconds lagged, and the image was all frozen, many times.When i turn on ""cast"" on google chrome browser, It overrides the current TV display switched to its google input channel automatically (without touching TV remote) but, it would not let me go back to other displays again when I turn off ""cast.That is a major inconvenience - each time, I have to walk to the TV remote to change back to other displays if google cast is unbearably flickering, Is the half the technology still considered convenient?

"Makes streaming easier","Before discovering the Chromecast I had been using my xbox one for YouTube, Hulu, Netflix, etc... The downfall to using the xbox for streaming services, is that you have to rely on the xbox network being up which has had some serious downtime in the past. Also occasionally the app on the xbox would get an update and not just not work.With the Chromecast all you need to worry about is your network and your connected device. That being said, not all phones are created equal, and some phones will struggle more than others.It's just made streaming more convenient. You can pause, fast forward, rewind, and even change the volume, all from your phone. People connected to your network can also control the Chromecast, with that it'd be nice to see a lock feature to keep others from disturbing your stream.Overall I really enjoy the Chromecast and I have one on each of my tv's in my place. I highly recommend getting one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2019","Joe",128

"Easy streaming, great quality","This is my third Chromecast. The first two were 1st gen units, one of which I still use. On the other 1st gen unit the HDMI port became bent and unusable. This new design seems much more durable. The HDMI port is on a cable, not built directly into the dongle. I decided to buy another Chromecast when I read Amazon Prime Video would no longer be supported on our old Wii U.Streaming with the Chromecast is extremely simple if you have an Android phone. I don't have any Apple devices, so I can't attest to how it works with iPhone. Start out by plugging the Chromecast into the HDMI port on your TV and hook up the USB power cable either to a wall plug using the included wall-wart adapter, or to the USB port on the TV. I used the port on the TV to reduce cable clutter. Turn on the TV and switch the appropriate HDMI port, and you should see the Chromecast startup screen. Download the Google Home app on your phone and have it search for devices. Tell the Chromecast which network to connect to and give it the password.Once it's connected to the network, you can select the cast icon in programs that support it, such as Prime Video, Youtube, Netflix, and many others. Video quality probably depends on your network. On mine, I have no problem with 1080p HD video. This version of the Chromecast doesn't support 4K, you need the Chromecast Ultra for that, but my TV doesn't support it either, so I just went with the non-Ultra unit. If an app doesn't support streaming, you can always share your phone's screen using the Home app, then run your app and it will be mirrored to the Chromecast. The quality isn't as good as an app that natively supports casting, but it works. I believe Chrome on a PC can cast as well, but I haven't tried that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2019","Andrew Reynolds",128

"Useless","Advertised as a way to cast from your smartphone to your older television. But it can't do that. For some asinine reason that only the nosy bastards at Google would understand it requires a second Wi-Fi connection. It insists on connecting to your phone with a wifi that it generates,(which should be all it needs) but that's not enough. It demands that you have Wi-Fi running in your home and that you allow it to have location information. If you have a Wi-Fi signal in your home, why would you need to cast from your smartphone?This is junk. There's absolutely no reason why they cannot create a device that simply bridges the gap between your phone and your television via an HDMI port wirelessly from A to B, and there's absolutely no reason why it needs to know where you are.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2021","Jason",129

"Using it to stream a VR feed from the phone","It's fast and easy to set up. Just plug in. Go to the web address shown on the screen. Download. Pick your Google acct, do the directed walk-through and bam! You can now stream any content you can see on your phone, from your phone, tablet, etc. to the TV w this device.Because we are streaming an Oculus VR, we had a couple extra steps. Go into the Oculus app, select the headset, then tell it to search for the new device (We named ours Living Room TV), select that, then select ""Start"" and we were off.Unlike other things we have tried, it streams fast enough to stay in sync with fast games like Beat Saber.We don't have the Wifi 6 either. Even though we have read it helps if the stream is a little slow, no problems.One day, when we can safely have friends over for gatherings, we will be able to set them up on the headset, then everyone can watch them battle robots, walk on the surface of Mars or just slice blocks in time to music.Amazing how well such an inexpensive little device works.(We read that if you don't have a 4k TV, buying the 4K version of this is a waste of money since it won't stream any faster, but you should do your own research.

"Terrible app but eventually it works","I did not get this for the reasons most people do, apparently. I have a samsung phone and a Toshiba TV, so I needed it to be able to mirror cast but I only try to use it at home (I have curiosity stream and I use some yoga and fitness apps I wanted to use with my TV). I have a smart TV so I don't need it for youtube, pandora, etc. So my use is really specific and limited. It does what I need it to, but it was a ridiculous pain in the ass to set up, it took me almost 2 hours of just doing the same thing over and over again. I followed the steps properly but every time it would inexplicably ""fail"" at a different step (no it's not my wifi network's fault, I was streaming something in the other room the whole time). So the Google home app apparently sucks. Once I nearly quit it decided to randomly start working and now it does what I wanted it to, so maybe I should give the device a better rating and give the app 1 star, but that wouldn't be reflective of my experience so whatever. I mean, this is GOOGLE we are talking about. And a pretty simple task that's built in to samsung TVs. Get your #### together, google. I've had off brand smart outlets with better app control.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2020","Katy",131

"Not useful to me","I could probably have learned that I had no use for this device without buying it, but I made (incorrect) assumptions about its utility. It does NOT work on Windows, Win10 at least but probably no version. I was able to cast from an Android phone, only a portrait view, onto my TV. Why would I want a tiny portrait view of anything on my TV? What I wanted, and thought I was getting, was a device that would Cast ANY screen from my PC to the big TV. That is, even if that screen did not have the cast icon. I can run a 50 ft HDMI cable from a PC to a TV, I wanted a wireless version of that cable, but Chromecast is not it.My phone is Samsung Galaxy S8+, running Android 9. Chromecast kept disconnecting, and I got a message (do not remember from where...Chromecast app?) saying ""Your phone is not optimized for chromecast mirroring."" Maybe it was Chromecast support who told me a gimmick to keep from disconnecting:On phone, turn off Mic Permissions, force close all apps, turn on Mic Permissions again.Any app that does have a cast icon will cast perfectly in HD from PC to TV using Roku. Roku's only shortcoming is needing that cast icon. There is apparently a component that is missing from Win10, that keeps me from sending a browser page withOUT the cast icon, to Roku. Something like ""miramax"" or similar. Something that used to exist but no longer does, it seems.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2019","Roger",132

"Works good, really","Setup was easy enough. The Google Home app is as intrusive as anything Google does, with the usual Google crap but it walked me through set up quickly and clearly. I set it up on my just-retired phone. I can check my mail, which takes me out of wifi range, while pausing my movie. Leave it paused too long, though, (maybe after 10 minutes or so) and plan on starting your connection over from scratch. A few problems. Sometimes the pause button is hard to find. Sometimes it's on the locked screen, sometimes you have to hit the unlock button, sometimes I have to turn the phone on. (As in, unlock the phone) Your connection to the web site may time out, while the content is still streaming through the unit. If you want to backtrack or fast forward, that can be a pain. I ran it all day yesterday, (Mostly youtube music, with movies and shows interspersed) and it spontaneously rebooted late at night. Unit and plug were warmer than I like to see, too.You don't actually mirror your phone screen on the tv screen, but if the media has the little ""cast"" icon, you can play it on the tv. Some sites, you have to go to full screen on your phone for the icon to appear. Prime, for example, will play series shows without interruption, but when a movie ends, I have to find the next one on the phone.It's not perfect, but it does work.They say to control the volume with the phone volume control, but the control on the tv works just fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2020","joe r",132

"Big Disappointment","I downloaded the two apps to my phone, setting up the controls on theTV and my iPhone 6S Plus. The TV and iPhone were sharing the same WiFi. The app showed a video of how to complete setup. But that was it. There were no instructions that worked to mirror Netflix to the TV. There were no FAQs that anywhere near dealt with the problem. That users are having a hard time with this chromecast dongle is reflected in the pleading on the ""contact us"" page that users would first send a lot of detail to them before doing negative reviews. There was no way that emails were going to solve this problem and of course there's no way to actually talk to someone. It was especially disappointing because I know how easily the Apple TV was set up. I tried to save money by using the chromecast, but I guess I have to bite the bullet and spend more for Apple. They also provide good support.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2021","KLB",133

"Easier set up than the original","It has been a few years since I installed the first Chromecast devices, and I was very pleased to find the set up on the new ones is much smoother and easier than the originals. So far works great.BTW, they do still come with a power supply that uses a standard USB cable, and a cable is included. So there is no need to order a shorter cable if your TV has a USB connection (most do). You can just take the power from there, and wrap up the extra cable to your taste. I am told that on newer TVs, if the Chromecast has its own power source, the TV can detect it if you begin casting and turn on automatically. I didn't need that, so I haven't tried it, but it won't work if the Chromecast is being powered from the TV's USB jack.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2022","A Constant Reader",134

"Laggy, drops-out","Purchased to use with Oculus Quest 2 VR headset. When it works, there's a minimum 1/2 second to 3/4 second lag behind what player sees. Apparently this is common, but you won't find it anywhere in the advertising brochure. It's designed more to stream highly-buffered movie content than extremely interactive gaming. This may be ok for casual showing to grandma, but makes it impossible for viewers to really ""connect"" what they see on screen with what the gamer did a second ago.Half the time it won't connect, or drops after a few seconds. Would not recommend for fast-paced interactive video games. The Oculus Quest 2 can also cast via Bluetooth to phone but this was also fairly laggy. If you really want to see what your Oculus gamer sees, skip the Chromecast and instead cast via WiFi to a PC (which worked with minimal-but-acceptable lag).","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2021","Amazon Customer",135

"Not worth it for my purposes (Updated)","UPDATED: Given an extra star because apparently switching to the 2.4GHz network has really made a difference in the reliability. It took a few uses, for some reason, for it to settle down, but it certainly has. If you're having problems, definitely switch to the 2.4GHz network. It's still a bit frustrating, and I'd still consider going Fire Stick next time around.I purchased this to stream videos from a browser tab on my PC to a TV just across the room. Should be simple, right? Nope. It will work fine for a few minutes, maybe even enough to watch a full period of hockey, but will invariably freeze up, disconnect, and tell me the source is not supported until I restart the TV. Sometimes it happens when I'm doing other browsing on the PC, sometimes it will happen even when I just leave it alone. I've tried connecting the Chromecast to both my 5GHz and my 2.4GHz networks, the 2.4GHz seems to be better but it also got off to a rough start and now stutters on occasion. We'll see if this holds up.When it's working, the picture and sound quality are just fine. I haven't really used the Hulu streaming option so maybe it's more reliable for that, and for some reason I cannot look my Netflix account to the Chromecast, but neither of those options are why I bought the Chromecast. If it continues to be a problem I will certainly invest in a Fire Stick instead.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2020","Stu729",138

"DOES NOT WORK RELIABLY FOR DESKTOP SCREENCASTING","Admittedly I probably should have done a little more research before purchasing. If I had done this, I would have discovered that the basic Chromecast has a documented bug/defect when it comes to screen casting a desktop from a Chromebook or other computer devices. If there is little as a 1ms buffering of the image, the Chromecast stops accepting the screencast input, and simply displays a static image of the last view before the buffering event. And since my SOLE reason for purchasing a Chromecast was that it was supposed to fully support screen casting from a Chromebook, as opposed to the 3 Firesticks we already own/use, which won't.

"Unreliable and Useless","Reasons I wanted this: 1) I'll be living in a hotel room away from home for a long time and want to cast from my phone to a TV and 2) Home internet is down and want to cast my stuff from phone to TV.1) Doesn't work on hotel WiFi because for security purposes hotels don't let devices see each other so chromecast and phone don't see each other. Awesome hotel IT made me my own network SSID so my devices can see each other, still didn't work. Tried putting chromecast on my phone hotspot. It got internet but usually couldn't cast.2) home internet is down for weeks. Tried the hotspot off my phone again. HBO app could cast to it for 2 days and 3rd day it couldn't (nothing changed). Tried connecting my phone and chromecast to husband's hotspot so they're on same wifi, still doesn't work.Summary: This thing and the Home app are useless and frustrating.If you want a streaming device, get an Amazon Fire stick.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2021","Snapdragon",141

"When signal fails movie starts back at the beginning","Maybe Google's QC has failed on this product or I was extremely unlucky and got the only partially functioning one from the factory.I though it would be nice to go wireless, but this is not the product to do it. I was able to get the device to see my computer and I could start watching a movie, but within 30 - 90 seconds it would slow down, then cut off the movie completely. A few seconds later the movie would come back, but it would start from the beginning. This is not acceptable.I could never get the device to play anything from my Google branded Pixel phone. If Google can't get their devices to talk to each-other, I can't imagine what it would be like if you did not have a Google phone?!I've spent many hours looking at the help communities and reading posts about this device. There is so much out there on how to troubleshoot this device. I guess if there is that much information it means a LOT of people are having problems.One piece of advice was to make sure your phone/computer is within 5 feet of the Chromecast (i tried it and it still would not work)! Then why not just buy a cable! I mean, really... If your phone/computer has to be on the same piece of furniture as the TV, then what is this really for?I am retuning this to buy a 15 foot cable for half the price and can still have my computer on my lap while I stream movies to my TV.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2020","Nathaniel D.",142

"Not user friendly for iPhones","My neighbor turned me onto to this device.

I then bought one after my neighbor’s and I can’t for the life of me get it to work. It won’t slideshow the pics automatically. I have to swipe my iPhone screen to see it on the TV. Plus, it won’t do videos from your phone unless I’m doing it wrong. Again, these large companies have very poor support service. I went out and did a search and found an app called Replica and guess what, in 3 steps I was able to watch my homemade iMovies and my pictures from my iPhone to my TV. Worked great.

"Way Way Way better than 2d gen APPLE TV","I will say this is way better than my second gen. Apple TV! The Apple is a piece of crap...Most newer smart tvs and smart phones can mirror directly to each other w/o the Google device, but the Google makes it a little easier to connect.Chrome cast is not perfect, sometimes when using my phone to cast from, it does not find the TV to pair with. You need to restart your phone or the Google device, then it works. Make sure tv and phone are using the same WiFi name.The streaming is good, very little if any skipping. The Apple skips often and I can't tolerate it.So I'll give the Google 3 stars because it's not quite as user friendly as I thought it would be.The other thing I dislike about the set up is you need to get the ""Google home app"" for the install, it wants to access your personal infoOn your phone....I just want to mirror what's on my phone!My solution was to download the app, then skip all the offer prompts it allows u to get through the set up, then uninstall the app from the phone. I set the tv to ""source"" where the Chromecast is plugged into, then find the cast icon on your phone.

"Requires a Google Home invasion, and cannot be turned off.","It works. Sort of.1. You have to install Google Home on anything you want to stream to it, even if you don't have any other Google Home devices. That means computers, phones and pads.2. Link is very slow to start. And I've had it fail in the middle of streaming a show and had to re-connect through Google Home on my phone. I have very fast, clean internet - there is no excuse for it to disconnect.3. It cannot be turned off. It has no sleep mode. It SUCKS power whenever it is plugged into something and STREAMS a repetitive set of images. My power bill went up $10 the first month. I unplugged it from the power, and it went back down. I can't gage how much bandwidth it stole. So I have to leave it unplugged when I'm not using it, which means I have to reconnect it when I want to use it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2021","Kindle Error 505",143

How that ability was added, I don't know but while watching a YouTube video on the PC, I noticed the screen share button. I clicked on it and saw that it was transmitting to the TV.

"Should have got one years ago!","Using with a laptop and Samsung GS7. Using with the phone is great. I simply open amazon prime video app, then cast direct from my phone to my TV. Plays smoothly as on my phone. I also had success casting an embedded streaming video in chrome (Android). I can still use my phone for other things including streaming other media (tune in radio). I tried casting my desktop, and it worked, but not as smoothly. Another negative about this use was, the desktop also showed the show, which was a bit distracting compared to using the phone. There may be another way?Like the title says, I've ummed and ahhed about the value of something like this since I saw my friend use one to cast kids shows on Netflix, to their play room TV in the basement, from the kitchen. I've been using a laptop connected to the TV via HDMI, which drops out now as the laptop gets old and the port wears out. I'm going to hold off replacing the laptop now. :) I have a Lenovo P10 tablet coming tomorrow so think that'll replace my laptop as a media device. My laptop is getting less and less use these days!I only have a 42"" TV so got the non 4k version. I figured if I get a bigger TV I'll get the ultra for that.

Afte some cable management, it was all nice and neatThe reason I gave it a 1 star review:...the enclosed instructions are useless. I had to refer to a you-tube video in order to get it working. Once I found a video to get it working, it worked fine. Really angry that there was not a complete set of instructions included. Also, the help page they referenced gave a 404 page not found error. So the online help was not available. If you are not tech smart, do your research before you buy. This should include any instructional videos you can find on you-tube.

I removed it entirely from the app and tried to add it as a new device. Again, unfindable. I'm really upset. I can't keep spending 30 bucks every couple of months -- that's ridiculous.

"Nothing But Problems","This is useless for me. Unfortunately, I didn't realize that the problems I was having were due to my chromecast rather than my wifi until I used my chromecast in another house, beyond the return period. I have had all types of problems. First, the video I was casting would frequently freeze or stutter. Like I said, I thought this was just due to my internet. but, when I finally got away from sheltering in place, and went to another location, I realized that the problem is the chromecast, not my internet. Today, I tried to watch an online film festival. Nope. The film won't play when I'm trying to cast it, but it works perfectly if I just play it on my computer. the minute I try to cast it, the movie stops. I can't get it to play until I stop casting. The other day, a video just froze, and the image stayed on my television. I had to unplug the chromecast and turn the television off and back on to get rid of the frozen image. Just stopping casting did nothing. Unfortunately, I'm now beyond the return date, so I have a useless piece of tech.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2020","mata",144

I bought a power strip that has ports fot the chromecast charge and tv power cord so it all works together. The bluetooth range is good. The only problem is having your phone be the remote, the app lets you control volume then when you cast the second app you are casting from also needs to be accessed sometimes to cast. Also you can start something and leave it streaming and some will keep playing while others stop or ask if you are still watching. It would be nice to have something on the tv screen that you could download the apps to and run like a smart tv.

"Sound becomes very distorted after a while...","We bought a 3rd generation chromecast to replace a 1st gen model thinking it was an improvement but while the picture quality is great, the sound will become very distorted while watching a movie - so much that it becomes unwatchable. This only happens after 20-30 minutes of continuous streaming and the only way to reset the sound is to hit the ""back 30 seconds"" button. This happens in all streaming apps so it not the app but is the chromecast causing it. Sometimes it fixes it for another 10-20 minutes, sometimes less. It doesn't do it watching shorter streams like TV shows with commercial breaks, only long, uninterrupted streams. Almost like it overheats. We've ordered a warranty replacement from Amazon and will try it out but if this one is a dud I guess we'll return it and try another casting device.

This newest replacement has not been an improvement. When we cast from YouTube specifically, which accounts for a lot of our daily watching, the audio cuts out for 1-2 seconds every 10-15 seconds or so. We've tried alternate HDMI ports and fiddling with the settings but no luck. My partner has no issues with audio when casting from her device. We both have Pixel phones. We're all-in on Google but it doesn't ""just work"" as you might imagine the Apple ecosystem would.

"Reliable Streaming Device -- if it can be played in Chrome Browser","It would be nice to be able to simulcast to multiple devices at once. Casting is nice but for me it seems like when my device that started casting subsequently powers off or goes to sleep, there's no way to reconnect other than stopping and restarting the cast.Setup was flawless. Hardware vendors should all learn from this. The only downside is it requires a mobile device ... not uncommon today but something to be wary off for some still-phoneless friends.The 6' USB Cable means for one of my TVs it's on with the TV is, off when the TV is off. Nice touch. For the other one the USB Adapter plugs into the same power outlet so one casting, it just continues. For anyone on a metered connection, be aware that you must stop casting to stop streaming.It's smaller than I thought but that's probably ok. It hangs behind my TV so now I have wireless casting for a clean living room setup.I can't cast from Chrome on iOS.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for over-the-top TV like Disney+ or YouTubeTV viewers.

"Works as advertised but worse than it's competitors.","I make youtube videos reviewing streaming players and I have to say the chromecast is probably my least favorite tv streaming device. On the positive side it works as advertised and does what it's supposed to, but it can be a hassle to use given you have to use your phone to cast the video stream instead of just using a dedicated remote. This becomes an issue for instance if you're charging your phone. My current ranking of the streaming devices I have would be as follows:1. Nvidia Shield2. Roku Streaming devices/ Roku TV3. Android TV Boxes (cheaper alternative to Nvidia Shield)4. Amazon Fire TV Devices5. ChromecastChromecast would be so much better if it had the option to use the Android TV OS with a dedicated remote.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2019","Amazing22",149

"I'm kicking myself for not using this years ago.","I use this to cast videos that I access through the chrome browser on my phone. And to cast videos that I download from the Internet using any Android video player app that I have on my phone.Chromecast does a terrific job doing both of these functions. It can easily keep up. When casting files on my phone, it never has any lag. It can cast my whole phone screen, without falling behind. By casting the whole screen,. You can use video players without support for Chromecast. I never use the streaming support for Netflix, etc. So I can't comment on Chromecast when streaming from a streaming service.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2022","bobp",149

"Can't even function as a paperweight.","I ordered a chromecast 3rd gen to use for streaming from an oculus headset. The first chromecast sent to me streamed one test youtube video and never worked again, dead just six hours out of the box. Solid orange light, wouldn't even factory reset, and Google's customer service threw in the towel. Amazon kindly sent a next-day replacement that also failed right out of the box. Runs through setup and then bricks after connecting to wifi. Phone can't see it, router can't see it. This one actually does factory reset, but the result is the same after every setup - ""Setup successful but your device cannot be found.""I will not be trying another replacement.

"Essential","I've been using chromecast for the past 7 years! The only reason I had to buy a new one is that I accidentally broke it -I was traveling to my parents and didn't know if they had smart TVs so I decided to bring my chromecast just in case and I didn't pack it well and it broke, otherwise I'd still be using the same one as it still worked perfectly.I HIGHLY recommend getting one, they are so convenient and I love being able to use it casting from my phone, tablet, nook, and computer. I don't have cable TV instead I use apps so being able to have something like this is crucial.I tried Amazon's fire stick about 5 years ago and I was super not impressed- the stick kept losing connection to the wifi even though it was literally right on top of the router and even when it was connected it would buffer a ton, never had those issues with my chromecast!!!So it's definitely worth the low price, they last for a super long time even being used pretty much all day, have had no issues being able to stream all the apps I've wanted to, and the screen saving pictures are beautiful....I can't recommend it enough!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2021","Brittany Campbell",149

"Works as described - but ...","Consider your internet and WiFi speed if planning to stream video from let's say a computer to a TV. Your network needs to be able to handle the stream coming from your provider and then at the same time re-send it to the Chromecast device, essentially doubling the traffic on your home network. In my case the result was unacceptably jerky video. This isn't a problem with the Chromecast device itself, it's a network capacity issue, but be aware of what might happen. If you're just sending a PowerPoint presentation or showing photos, for example, it would work great, although there is a tiny delay between the source and the TV that can make navigating with a mouse while looking at the slightly-delayed screen image on the TV difficult. Still better than dealing with a cable though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2019","P K. Dillon",150

"This works out exactly as I hoped! A lot of instructions and tutorials to go through, but worth it!","I was having trouble trying to get my HDMI to VGA adapter working properly to connect my TV to the Internet, so instead I opted for this Chromecast purchase. I plug it into the HDMI on my TV and then install the Chromecast app and Google Home app on my iPhone to connect. Your TV has to be directly connected to the internet of course for this to work properly and your phone must be connected to the same WiFi in your house. Once you have those all updated, you then download the apps to your phone: Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Peacock etc. to properly cast them to your TV. Your apps all need to be also updated on your TV Cast app (The app needs to know about your streaming apps... I know, all lays it on a bit thick). Once you have downloaded all that properly, you should be able to cast whatever your phone is about to play (instead of it playing on your cell phone) and then hit the cast button in the top right corner of the Netflix app, Hulu app, Disney+app, Peacock and etc apps to send the stream to your TV instead. Voila! Your TV is streaming! This works especially well for older smart TVs that work just fine, but don't quite have Disney+ because that service is too new to show up in your TV's app store. The Chromecast is like an additional gadget to get an upgrade.Hope this all made sense and your Chromecast works as well as mine does on all my streaming services. -G","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2021","Greg Van Cott",151

"You CANNOT use Prime Video OFFLINE with Chromecast","If you use Prime Video to download videos to watch OFFLINE on a supported device (phone, tablet, Chromebook, etc.), you CANNOT cast the video to Chromecast and watch the downloaded video. Instead, you get a dialog that informs you that although you have downloaded the video, the video will be STREAMED ONLINE to the Chromecast. This totally defeats the purpose of downloading a video to watch offline on a large screen TV via the Chromecast. In my case, I have satellite internet and CANNOT stream ANYTHING and must resort to downloading videos and watch OFFLINE. This small detail was not obvious from the Prime Video and Chromecast information.

"Simply doesn't work","For about three weeks after I bought this it did what it said: I could open up youtube on my browser, start a video, and cast to my TV where it would play as if it were cable. All of a sudden it stopped doing that, and no amount of reseting or power cycling will change it. If I hit the cast button on my browser (Chrome) it opens up a youtube interface on the TV, which allows me to look through my library or search for things using the clunkiest search function in history (well done Google!). What it doesn't do is simply play the video I was watching on my browser. I have to add the video to a list and then get to it through the clunky interface on the TV.As if that isn't bad enough, the casting process will occasionally simply stop and nothing will get it going again. I have to cycle the power on the device, but that means I lose my place in the video and even the fact that I was watching that particular video, and need to go back to square one with finding it in one of my lists or searching for it again. Add the fact that the navigation onscreen is hobbled by using a remote, and the frustration of using it simply isn't worthy the hassle.My computer is slightly old, and so is my TV, so maybe if you have only hardware purchased within the past year or so and are running only Google products it will work just fine. If you don't have the latest and greatest, this device will simply make you hate Google.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2021","Andrew Case",152
"Need a smart phone or computer savy to make it work","This thing liked to drive us crazy trying to set it up. It is designed to be used with a smart phone and we don't have one. I almost had our daughter come over and use her smart phone to set it up but it would not have helped because you use the smart phone as the remote! I have a Fire tablet and our son figured out how to set it up as an Android device, downloaded Google Chrome, did a bunch of other stuff I don't understand, but finally I can use my Fire tablet to access Disney+. It only took three hours to figure it out. I even had the return label printed and was going to send it back to Amazon when son said he could try something else and got it to work.

Have to download apps like Facebook or Youtube to my phone to be able to stream videos from those services. Download those same apps to the Roku Ultra and save them there. Too many apps on my phone already. Don't want to waste space by installing more just to stream to the Chromestick. I end up going back to my Roku Ultra to watch most of the streaming video services that I like. Use the Chromsestick once in a while when I want to stream directly from my phone.

You can share your desktop's screen with Google Chrome and the Google Home ecosystem. Setup is very easy and simple. I wish a remote control came with the device as it is a bit of a hassle to control everything from the Google Home app. The Ambient Mode is so beautiful as well and I love that you can customize it so much. With that said, I don't like that you cannot pair the Chromecast with your Bluetooth speakers or any other speakers other than your TV speakers.

"Better than the Firestick! (so far)","I previously had an Amazon Firestick that constantly crashed and would spontaneously decide to reboot in the middle of me watching things, so I wanted to replace with something else and got the chromecast. At first I was a little concerned about not having a dedicated remote (you have to use your phone or another device to control it), but it has actually been really nice being able to (relatively) seamlessly switch between streaming across different devices -- if I am watching a video on my phone, I can just throw it on my tv via chromecast as opposed to making watching TV a separate/dedicated action. I also like that the flexibility of casting from my phone lets me stream things from almost any source, not just things with apps. My main complaint would be there are still a lot of steaming services (i.e. HBO) that do not have voice control yet (although I believe many are in the works), so you have to use your phone to control and cannot start a new episode just through voice control.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2020","Customer",154

However, it really has its issues, particularly with Netflix and YouTube. When I'm casting a show/video and simply want to pause it or go back, skip forward, stop, etc. the apps on my phone seem to forget that Google is Chromecasting so I have to close the app I'm casting from and restart it every time. It's so frustrating. I don't know if the issue is my phone or with the actual ChromeCast, and I have no idea how to fix it, but it's still better than an HDMI cord so I've just kinda learned to live with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2019","Victoria Lamb",154

It seemed to make sense to connect the chromecast to the faster 5G network, but that turned out to be a very bad idea. The chromecast constantly lost its network connection and froze, so I had to unplug and replug it to get things going again. Very annoying! After a bit of googling I found more 5G streaming device testaments of woe. So I connected my chromecast and phone to the 2.4 G network and haven't had a single problem since. 2.4 G is plenty fast for streaming movies, and I haven't noticed any problems in using my phone on the slower network either.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2022","Katja",155

"Overall good, but NO RESET BUTTON","Overall, I love this product. It works like a charm out of the box. An unexpected pro: I can cast from my PC, and I cast things I wouldn't have expected I could cast, e.g., Spotify. Nice feature if, like me, you don't have good PC speakers.So, why the four stars? Because it lacks a reset button. Why do you need a reset button? Because when the internet goes out and then comes back, sometimes there no way to get the Chromecast to connect back to the network other than resetting the device, which requires plugging and unplugging the device. Really stupid way of doing things, and really awkward if your TV's ports are located in the back.Something else to consider: I like to watch TV while I eat, which sometimes make me wish I had a physical remote instead of having to use my phone to control the TV--easier to clean a remote than a smartphone screen, so you really don't want to get grease on your smartphone's screen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2020","Arturo Javier",155

After watching a show, getting the controls to come back on the iPad are an absolute pain. Sometimes I can grab the controls in the app I’m streaming with, other times I have to go into the Home app to get them to work, and sometimes I can’t get them at all and have to disconnect and reconnect to get them back.

"Works poorly with a weaker Wi-Fi signal","With a strong Wi-Fi signal, it works pretty well, and I have few issues with it. But with a medium-strength signal (2 to 3 bars out of 3 on my phone), it works extremely poorly. The Chromecast and the phone constantly get out of sync (e.g. one is paused but the other thinks it's playing), but neither side realizes it. Often this can only be fixed by restarting the casting app, or even unplugging the Chromecast. The way I ended up fixing it was by buying a new Wi-Fi access point to put in the same room as it, because a couple rooms over wasn't good enough. This is with the YouTube app by the way, which is part of Google.Google really needs to do better QA in non-perfect network conditions. The Wi-Fi was plenty good enough to stream the actual videos in full HD; why is it not good enough to send commands properly?","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2021","Backpack Potato",156

"Google sucks, must have wifi and google membershipip","You have to have wifi for both tv and your phone, it is not plug and play, it makes you sign up to Google accounts, download apps before letting you know that you have to have wifi to even make it work ,which I do not. It is supposed to mirror your phone to your tv but you can not without wifi, then you uninstall all the crap you just downloaded only to have your phone somehow screwed up from the recent apps ,it now glitches ,freezes, and plain do s not work like it should, this is the second review I started the first one Completely blanked out /white screen and tried going back to Google services which I deleted and then it froze, I had to take the battery out and restart it. This is a Google virus scam and amazon should remove it .it doesn't work unless you count the malware left behind then it works as they intended.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2022","fieldresearch",156

"Some challenges with this product","It was fairly easy to setup and the app installed easily to all of the devices we synced to it. There are just a few issues that are annoying. 1- The volume at startup is LOUD. It kicks in at MAX LEVEL every time and I have not found a setting to adjust this on any of the devices we use. We purchased this for the bedroom and it is hard to switch from regular TV to this device without waking someone who is sleeping. The only solution is to have your finger ready to adjust the volume as soon as it kicks in - not a ""good"" solution. 2 - If you close down the app on your device while watching you lose the ability to control the streaming content because when you launch the app again it doesn't recognize the content streaming. The only solution I have found for this is to find the item we are watching again - and relaunch it. This is just annoying. It doesn't happen every time... but most of the time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2020","Tiffanie LaBruyere-Drown",157

"Finally Amazon supplies Chromecasts!","In my opinion, Chromecasts are king because they follow the KISS principle. I don't want a device that provides smartTV features that I don't even use and am not interested in. I want something that does it's one function and never complains and rarely breaks. I don't want to deal with another remote or the hassle of navigating menus. My phone is my remote. Period. When I want to watch something, most apps support the Chromecast natively and if they don't, I simply mirror my screen. No menus, no interfaces, nothing new to learn. I simply load up my app and cast it. BUH BAM, simple and effective!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2020","Customer",157

"Loses connection intermittently","We have multiple chromecasts (this generation) and after a few days, they for no reason lose connection to google home and are unresponsive and undetectable. Unplugging them seems to fix it, but what good does this unit do if you need to consistently go touch the wire and unplug it frequently(every few days or so). This was designed to streamline the 'streaming' process, but this does the opposite. do not buy.Not to mention, the wireless signal is pretty low for a wifi device. The signal will drop, and sometimes not come back until you reset the chromecast. Some apps like peloton and youtube will drop the connection briefly, and then RESTART the media. When doing a workout, that defeats the purpose of streaming to another device. Again, do not buy.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2020","Vinny",157

"Returned......unreliable and full of bugs.","I had one of these a few years ago, and really liked it. It had a simple app, almost everything I wanted to cast worked, and I pretty happy, I quit using it when I switched to a Roku, and lost it somewhere along the way. I decided to buy a new one, and wow am I dissapointed. You would think after 3 years, it would have improved! First, the original app is not available, now you have to use this garbage google home that looks and runs like somebody's HS intro to programming class project. It attempted to take over everything in my house from my Roomba, to my Sonos sound system. The only thing it couldn't find was my chromecast! After much screwing around, and setting up a dedicated, unsecured, router.......connecting the phone and the chromecast to the same router.......it sort of worked. I could cast some things, but almost nothing worked like the original one I had years ago. When it did work, the interface and controls were horribly slow. I mostly blame the google home app, which is completely ridiculous, a giant security issue, and incredibly buggy. I also suspect this is the main reason 3 years ago this was a 5 start item, and now it's dropping steadily. Returned and purchased another Roku.....a far far better device.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2019","EricB",158

"Great until it stops working.","I love the idea of the Chromecast and was a big fan of the 1st Gen, but I’ve been having constant problems with the 3rd Gen.When it works it’s great: clean design, good quality video, & little buffering. However, after being on for a while it will inevitably randomly disconnect from your device before the video freezes a few seconds later. While it is frozen a loading/buffering animation will play in the center of the screen but it will never fix itself no mater how long you leave it. The only solution is a restart by unplugging it (as the reset button won’t work).At first I thought I received a defective product so I returned it and requested a new one. However, the new one also has the same issue (if not as common as the first device).Looking online for help I was told I had a bad WiFi connection, but the device is 3’ away from my WiFi router. I was told maybe the TV was interfering with the WiFi so I attached it to an extender cable to get it away from the TV. No dice.Maybe dropping $70 on a wired Chromecast might fix it, but I’m not sure I want to drop so much on a device that’s giving me so much trouble and I honestly doubt it’s really the WiFi.I’ve gone back to a 1st gen Chromecast for the time being. Despite it’s low picture quality and buffering at least it doesn’t require me to reset it nightly. :(","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2020","Bryan",159

"Constant issues","I purchased it in March specifically for the expected increase in home time due to the pandemic, so it's less than a year old and it causes me constant problems. It keeps disconnecting from apps, needs to be hard reset at least once a month and sometimes even that doesn't work the first time. When it does work, half the time the stream is blurry or out of sync between the visual and the sound. I don't have these issues when I'm watching directly on my phone or laptop and I've checked my wifi speed recently - 400+mbps - so that's not it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2020","K.

"Virtually useless","This is a poorly designed product with awful endurance. It is fundamentally a device that is only useful for displaying various error messages related to connectivity issues in spite of range from wi-fi router and inabilities to stream applications for unspecified reasons. I may venture to even say that error messages have been displayed for longer durations than any movie or video I have, on anomalous occasions, been able to actually stream on this device. It is $30, however, so this is certainly a poster child for the saying ""you get what you pay for"". If I were to do it over again, I would go for something that is more functional, even if it is more expensive. This is an error-prone headache.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2022","Jay",162
"Extreme latency, unsuitable for most applications","Headline says it all. All I wanted was to stream my desktop display to the TV but MASSIVE latency (I'm talking over 1000 ms) makes this thing an expensive paperweight. I have gigabit internet and frequently game while streaming with a download in the background and have no problem, so I know my connection is good. Even with no programs open with no other drains on the bandwidth, however, it still has a massive latency. My phone casts to the same tv with no issues. Router and connection are absolutely not the problem. I don't know if this is a planned obsolescence thing or what because Steam and Razer both have functional products that do the same thing but this device is absolutely worthless.

This year though, all these apps (Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu) have reallyyyy slowed down (or perhaps the rest of the world just sped up). I bought the chromecast and it has changed everything. Seriously, it works flawlessly and you use your phone/computer (whatever device you're casting from). Once I set up the chromecast with one device, the chromecast was visible to all other devices seamlessly. Just make sure your device and the chromecast are connected to the same wifi network.

Chromecast Ultra is way too expensive just to add 4k/HDR support.All the above said, I went with a Chromecast over a competing product because of the Google Assistant integration and because of the ability to cast from a chromebook or my phone. So, I can control music playback easily using voice or the phone, and I can put up spreadsheets/presentations wireless on the TV.

"Product support","I bought a Chromecast 3rd generation because I have two other ultras that I own and want a backup. I ordered this unit on June 1, 2020. Last month, I replaced my router with a Netgear mesh router and two satellites. The two ultra Chromecast work fine; however, this 3rd generation does not appear in my list of devices. The software goes through all the motions, but at the end of the setup process, a message appears the unit has successfully loaded but may not show up in the devices' list. I have tried everything from restarting my router to resetting the Chromecast to factory settings to no avail. I reached out to tech support, but no one seems to support my need. I do not recommend this product if you are in the market for a simple casting device. Especially since Google isn't offering any resolution to my issue. I do not typically complain about a product, but in this case, I am not a happy customer.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2020","Robert S.",167

I even factory reset it, did all the troubleshooting i could find on google(which was almost always reset it, reset your phone, reset your router, factory reset) I'd rather go back to using physical media than ever use this thing again.

You can use google music, but it would be nice to cast music from the apple music app, after all you can cast other more complex media. I also tried to bring it to someone else's house (I was house sitting), and it was only telling me that I was not connected to wifi, however it was not giving me the option to set it up on a new network which was very frustrating.

The marketers did their number on me I guess. It does work well and as advertised. The thing is since I already have roku and mostly watch high definition youtube videos, I am not using this one that much. Amazingly, it does not even have a great youtube app like roku even though both companies are owned by the same alphabet agency or something like that. This is mainly a screencaster. Dial something up on your tablet or phone and cast it to your TV it does that very well. The thing for me is I can already do that with my roku. It does have a nice screensaver. Problem it stays hot as hades all the time even when u arent using it I suppose its just collecting intelligence for the alphabet mothership all the time or something who knows. I have it turned off at the moment out of concern for the 5g radiation behind my head while I'm sleeping all nite. So it's ok.

"Setup a bit wonky but functionality great","I never thought I would need to purchase a Chromecast because I have been very happy with my Fire Stick. Unfortunately Hulu Live TV recently developed a software issue with Fire Sticks and Rokus where the video freezes up and remains that way until the software resets. (Hulu is aware of the issue.) So, I looked for a streaming hardware alternative since I like the channels and format offered by Hulu Live. The Chromecast was the least costly alternative to the Fire Stick. I'm glad I discovered this alternative. The setup was a bit wonky and didn't work the first time. The Chromecast couldn't read my TV correctly. I have a smart TV that became dumb when it could no longer read my wifi, so I need that interface that a Fire Stick or Chromecast provides. So, I reset the Chromecast and reinstalled the Chromecast. It worked this time. While I like the onboard functionality and menus that Fire provides and Chromecast does not, the Chromecast will do its job for me. The Chromecast also is controlled by an Android or iOS phone. This is pretty slick and makes it easy to control the functions of not only the Chromecast, but Hulu and my TV as well. I will still use my Fire Stick with most of my other paid streaming services, but I'll use the Chromecast for Hulu Live TV. This has (hopefully) put the video freezing issue in my rearview mirror.I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because of the issues with the setup.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2021","KO_Happy",175

"Why is this still a product?","So here is what I did a while ago... I bought a Hiearcool USB C Hub for my Samsung s4 tablet because I have an older TV I can't cast to. I plugged my tablet into the hub, the hub into my TV via HMDI, and it worked perfectly. Just hit the cast button on the tablet, choose the TV, and you are done. The only problems being that while plugged in, you can't turn the tablet screen off. And of course, you have to keep your tablet cabled. So I figured I would get one of those Chromecast things, and eliminate the cable. Go full-wifi. Well, that was a bad idea.From the beginning, I didn't like the device because as I learned, you need Google Home on Android to cast to it, which I had already uninstalled from my tablet because it was obviously just a way for Google to attempt to steal more of my information. My hub just worked right out of the box. But I reinstalled it and gave it a shot. Unlike the hub, there was a setup and update process. The hub I just plugged in and it worked fine. I still had to use the hub because this Chromecast has no option for connecting my wireless usb mouse. The first serious issue I noticed is that the screen kept going back to the setting of fit width instead of fit height, thereby cutting off the android screen options top and bottom (notifications and home screen icons). Then while testing out some Netflix using the app, I was getting sound, but no picture. Googling for help didn't provide much of it. Just a lot of confusing posts about people guessing at what the cause of the problem was.The wifi connection was fine, though honestly, the wifi router, Chromecast, and tablet are all within a few feet of each other, so it is what you would expect. But I tried it out elsewhere, and even casting down stairs to the living room produced a very nice, clear picture. Except for Netflix video for some reason. I figured I would solve the problem eventually, and went on to test out the device. Other video channels seem to be fine. But there were still other negatives.It seems you need to always keep the Chromecast powered - plug or TV usb. The USB C hub is powered by the tablet, with a pass-through that allows you to charge the tablet without having to remove the hub. And the hub is always just a little warm to the touch even after hours of use. The Chromecast is very hot to the touch after just a few minutes. And after leaving for a while and coming back, the Chromecast didn't connect automatically to the tablet. I had to do a restart the tablet. Only happened once, so it may have been a fluke.So with the hub being $10 less, its own real disadvantage was the cable from the tablet to the hub. But compared to the Chromecast, that seemed like a non-issue at the end of the day. So with there being a cheaper and more seamless option that requires practically no setup or updates, works consistently well, and doesn't need Google Home, why is Chromecast still a thing?I will keep the Chromecast for when I travel or visit friends so I can keep my tablet in my hands, but quite honestly, it is going to get very little use at home.*The one thing I should note about the Hiearcool USB C Hub and other hubs like it is that it only works with devices that allow for a HDMI direct connection. Not all tablets do, so you have to check your tablet specs first to see if it is capable. Otherwise, casting through wifi is your only option.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2020","C. D. Johnson",176

For some weeks it worked to reboot the device (unplug, wait and plug in again), and then it stopped connecting. Spent unreasonable amount of time on Chromecast/help site, following instructions carefully. I suspect that it's a hardware problem, but the amount of time and frustration it caused was completely unreasonable.

Skips and stutters the sound and video constantly. Especially if there's a lot of movement on the video or screen. I can't even use my visualizer while playing music because it's too much for the Chromecast to keep up without constantly skipping the sound and video being completely blurry.

"Google Chromecast can make any screen a smart TV","The Google Chromecast is an absolute must-have in any household that has a Google Home Speaker already installed. If you don't have a Google speaker already in your household then any Android phone works just as well with the Chromecast. This little device has the ability to make any TV or projector TV into a smart TV. There's tons of entertainment and steaming applications that can be used on this device. The applications do have to be downloaded on your device and can't be saved directly to the Chromecast device. Chromecast gives you the ability to make your phone control what your watching or listening to. When used along with the Google Home Speaker settings can be enabled which has the ability to entirely control the TV and which applications you are viewing on the screen completely with only your voice and the correct commands.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2019","Dani DeFoe",180

You also don't need to log into your accounts on the device, since it just Chromecasts right to your TV, and you can modify the volume, what's playing, etc from there.You don't need to change HDMI outlets manually - it will switch automatically if you put something up to stream.You can chromecast a tab on your computer, or the entire screen, just as easily as your phone.Setup is ridiculously easyPrice is low and no monthly/recurring costIt's easy for other people to hop on and use at the same time, since they just need their phoneThe screensavers that it flashes between when not playing anything are beautiful!Cons:This actually needs to be plugged into an outlet along with the TV.

To use it for audio only you need to add an HDMI audio extractor that will work without having a display for the HDMI handshake to allow audio only and it needs 'a little slapping around' to get audio only support. It would be nice if the new Chromecast with Google TV had an audio breakout jack(s) that provided good quality higher res audio support if Google is not going to re-release the Chromecast Audio.

The picture quality isn’t that great though, but for $35 I can’t complain.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2020","Megan",190

Even my Pixel 2's support menu says I can connect to the Chromecast over Bluetooth, which is not the case - it requires an active internet connection. I am very displeased with this product.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2020","Rick",198

"Too Unstable","LAST UPDATE 2-25-2021 - Frustrated near the point of insanity, I gave up, returned it. Amazon was great trying to help. I could NOT get the dongle to stop disconnecting. If there is something I did not try over 2 months, I don't know what I missed. I finally used software to tell me what everything in my network was doing. The problem was never my phone, never my router, never band width, I finally caught the dongle disconnecting and got confirmation. I ordered an MHL ($18) and hardwired my needs with USBC from my phone to HDMI plugged into my monitor. Time to open package and download app 1.5 minutes. Total set up time 22 seconds. End result ... PERFECT. All I ever wanted was to monitor an outdoor security camera. I have my tablet sitting next to my monitor 10 feet away from me so no cable is running across the floor. Everything is hidden behind the monitor. I use my phone, which is also WIFI connected to the outdoor camera as is my tablet is, to manipulate the camera. It all works flawlessly, and the picture on the monitor is radically great (HDMI quality). Oh what a relief it is!UPDATE 2-8-2021: Final chapter, problem solved but I don't like it:Disconnects continued. Tired of messing with this I set up the MOST IDEAL SETUP and tested to see if I could make this dongle work under the most optimum conditions possible. I moved my router, my phone, and this dongle attached to the monitor I was casting to, to TOUCHING distance apart. Literally in a neat pile touching each other. The disconnects finally stopped. I bought a 10 foot HDMI cord (not happy I had to), and relocated my router to a new but equally as powerful location as the former. I ran the HDMI cable from the monitor connection to my router, and DUCT TAPED this dayme dongle to the side of it!!!!! No more disconnects. Folks, I have EIGHTEEN WIFI devices, indoor and out, some 6 times as far from my router as this dongle was, and not a single one has ever spontaneously disconnected. If you say you never had this problem, I believe you, but I can conclude nothing other than MY dongles were lame. Didn't expect this from a Google product.UPDATE: 2-3-2021: I read a comment on another forum that if you just can't figure out the disconnects, it just might be the dongle itself is defective (duh... why didn't I go there?). I asked Amazon to send me a replacement so I could test that. They had one on my door step 10 hours later (Amazon is so great in so many ways). I installed the new dongle. It has been connected for 6 consecutive hours (last thing last evening the old one was disconnecting every few minutes). If this dongle goes a few weeks without going insane, I'll let you all know.I am giving this one star in all aspects because it is just such a hassle. It works fine for a short time (few days-couple of weeks) then with NO CHANGES made to my network... and I mean NONE...ZERO, this dongle goes into a fit of disconnects, over and over, every few minutes. Google says there are MANY fixes. The one I found that works is to RESET and set up with the Home app AGAIN. That does stop the problem.... for a few days-couple of weeks again. I never have to make any adjustments to any other part of my network. If I had known this was going to need so much dam babysitting I would have never bought it. I have many wireless devices: cameras, smart lights, Nest minis, monitors, head phones, RGBIC strips... blah blah... NOTHING ELSE behaves badly, just this Chromecast DONGLE.

I would recommend getting the option with the remote for this. That aside, its great.

"not as flexible as I was expecting","I've got a projector with only one HDMI input, but I have a couple of devices that connect to it through a splitter, which has been working fine for a couple of years. All but two of the devices can be configured to output in either RGB or ycbcr. This apparently only outputs in ycbcr, while my more frequently used PS4 only outputs in RGB. Hence, it's a minor hassle to go into the projector settings and change the input mode when I want to use the chromecast and then change it back when I'm done.Like plenty other of these app-driven devices, it can also be slow and inconsistent for the Home app to connect and respond. It's similar to driving an Apple TV from the remote app, which is typically only something I resort to when a kid has hidden the physical remote somewhere. Plus, casting isn't as universally available as I was expecting. Most apps it works in, but some have it intentionally disabled, apparently.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2019","Kel",231

"Works great, love it, but it can and does overheat","Turns my older but still trusty TV into a multimedia center. Works great with YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, and yes, Amazon Prime Video. Setup is a little quirky.Why three stars for a pretty cool little product? This device has a fairly major flaw - it overheats. In fact, it gets so hot, it will shut off after a few minutes of streaming HD video. I read about other users modding theirs to add heat sinks, but I just set up a desktop fan behind my TV and aimed it at it and that works great.Still though, definitely not ideal. Future models may have solved this problem, so I am only speaking specifically about the 3rd Generation Chromecast.Do you have a TV in your bedroom that's a few years old, but you still wanna Netflix and Chill? Buy this little device, its awesome! But be advised you may need a fan.

"disappointed.","i gave one star on volume control because it doesn't even have that. I was disappointed in this product. Look, i get that it is cheap..... but it is the same price as an HDMI -> USB-C cable, and it works WORSE than one of those cables. It drops the connection to my phone frequently, and sometimes won't reconnect. Then i have to reboot my phone, then the chromecast, then the router, depending on how badly the problem is. Super annoying! Also: i am sitting less than 3 feet from the router, with the phone on the same desk, and the chromecast receiver less than 5 feet away. Really short distance and it doesn't stay connected! Not trying to leave a bad review, but im just being honest that it was a big disappointment and I wish i just bought a cable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2022","M A",260

"Google Chromecast (3rd Generation) Really Nice & Affordable.","This Google Chromecast really was simple to install, is well made and works quite well with most programs that have cast capabilities. The picture quality is excellent and the Ease of use couldn't be simpler. My only complaint would be if Google and Amazon could resolve their issues with each other and work together. The only kink in using this casting device is with Amazon-Prime video use. You can use it but not with an Apple phone as your remote. You have to ""start/stop/pause"" from your Amazon program on the computer. One company or the other does not allow this to work with an Apple iPhone (hence the 4-star rating). Other than that, this is well worth the bang for the buck.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2019","johnnyt2",261

The one I received before must have just had some issue because this one has worked perfectly from the start!I received a defective product. I plugged it in and set it up no problem and was very happy to have it working. 1 hour later the cast suddenly ended and told me my chromescast was not connected. The light on the device continually blinks orange and I am not able to even factory reset the device. I disconnected the chrome cast from my google home and tried to reconnect it but the device was not detectable and could not be found no matter what I did. In the end I have to assume the device is broken. I’ve put in for a replacement to be sent to me and I’m hoping this one will work properly.

"Don’t buy! Very frustrating device to use!","Get a Firestick instead... This thing is a giant pain in the ass to use! You have to download an app to your phone to use it, so that you can cast the video from your phone to the TV via the Chromecast... That’s all fine and good if it worked!The problem is that it takes forever to set up the phone connection to the Chromecast... usually took me more than 5 minutes to get the phone to link to the device which involves unplugging the device or resetting it, or restarting my phone before it worked.The other issue was that once the link was established it was easily broken if you wanted to pause, fast-forward or rewind the show you’re watching too frequently!It’s an extremely frustrating device to use, so I just bought a few Firesticks and now it has been relegated to the guest bedroom!!","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2019","Chris",284

"You CAN'T use this without some WAN internet connection somewhere","Maybe some of you are looking at this because you share my goal: to play video files you own to an HDMI screen without any internet connection. ""No internet"" means a local wifi network is okay, but no data from ""outside"", even over a cellphone connection. I mean like if you're in a remote cabin in the woods, or if you're in a hotel in a foreign country where you have no cell service and no internet connection at all. This *should* be a simple goal: data on a hard drive, transmitted over a wireless connection to a Chromecast (or Roku or ...), to watch on a screen.A few places on the internet seemed to suggest that as long as you have a local connection (LAN, not WAN), the newer Chromecasts would allow you to play video files over that LAN. But this is simply false, as I can attest simply by experimentation, and as a Google product support specialist later confirmed for me. I could stream files from my Western Digital Wireless Pro (basically a hard drive with travel router attached) to the Chromecast *only* while the WDWP was itself connected to the internet. Same story with various other configurations I tried, including a RAV Travel router - everything works fine until the moment the LAN is no longer connected to the internet, and then it mysteriously stops working, even though all the data it needs is all local.The Roku stick won't let you do it either, by the way. This is maddening, in my book. The only ways I found to get content onto an HDMI TV from a video file basically involve either a large flash drive plugged into the TV's usb port (always clumsily handled by the TV, in my experience), or a *wired* connection like a cave person (for example, from my iPad via a lightning-to-HDMI dongle and a *long* HDMI cable), or else using a Raspberry Pi. Stupid, but there it is.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2020","Stephen Petersen",287

Trying to cast these to the Chromecast will just make it start streaming from the internet - it does NOT play the offline video downloaded on your phone.

"Does not have screen mirroring for iOS devices....","I bought this unit specifically to mirror screen my iPhone to my 2015 smart Samsung TV. Some reviewers said it would do it and others said it would not. So I gave it a try. I installed it to my TV, downloaded and installed the required app, but it didn't work. iPhone and TV both have mirror screening options available, both were using the WiFi signal, both devices showed to be connected to the internet wifi and ready to be connected, but neither device could find the other. After a lot of research about this unit, I finally found the one sentence I was looking for: The unit will not mirror screen with iso devices. BINGO!!This unit may be perfect for all the things it's advertised to do, but according to their own troubleshooting information, it cannot ""mirror screening"" or air play ""mirror screening"" with iso devices, regarding of what other reviewers may say.

"Doesn't work on HP chromebook","This product is great to run from an iPhone. However, it won't run from my HP chromebook. I spent about 2 hours online trying to fix the problem, followed by 50 minutes of tech support from chromecast, and I only have audio but no video when casting from the chromebook. If you are a teacher or presenter and want to utilize this product when presenting, you will be disappointed, unless you present from your iPhone. I would have given 5 stars if i only tried it on my iPhone, but the fact that it is easier to run from iPhone than from a chrome operating system on a chromebook shows that it has fundamental flaws. And to those that suggest it is just ""operator error"", it operates fine from my iPhone after I set it up. The chromecast tech support could not fix the issue either.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2021","chmst1999",308

It doesn’t come with a remote and truly I am not mad at that not at all, not for the price and how easy it was to set up! As you can see I’m watching Netflix from my iPhone 7, my iPad was too old to be compatible lol but I’ll take it!

Also the casting feature seems to work intermittently and not consistent. We pretty much stopped using it. Lastly there's a tiny manual which was not helpful at all and with limited online support.Hello? Google!!!

Guest mode enables someone to connect to it without connecting to your wifi, but if the chromecast isn't connected to wifi the cast button won't appear in any apps.The chromecast does not show up in Smart View, there is no Bluetooth signal for casting. If connected to chromecast through wifi, can't use mobile data to bring anything up. Was just a very frustrating experience.

"Data required","Not really a review as I barely used it. I'm sure it is a good enough streaming device but that was not what I was expecting. I did read the puck needs Internet for setup and sure enough it immediately updated its firmware when connected. But I expected once configured and connected to my phone, it would mirror the content on my phone, using my phone's data like a Bluetooth speaker. Turns out it can only stream content via WiFi. I should have known since there are no Bluetooth or NFC options for connecting to your phone.Google calls it a ""cast"" because the controlling device ""casts"" the link to the content for this puck to begin its it's own streaming. Your phone merely acts as a remote control. In other words, if you've cut the Internet cord, this puck does nothing but drain your hotspot bucket.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2019","Darryl Baker",336

"Not up to expectations.","Pros: easy to install and set up. And when it works, it’s great.Cons: I have to reset mine about once a week. Phone won’t recognize it half the time. No troubleshoot help on the app except it just tells me to unplug it and plug it back in. This is as bad as having a dial on my TV to change channels- actually it’s worse and takes way longer for the reset to upload. Really annoying when I am half way through a movie and my kids are not used to a 15 min intermission as it will quit randomly. Maybe mine is just faulty or my kids are spoiled- both probably true. It’s slowly getting better over time, but keeps happening.

"Great but it only works half of the time","I have my whole house in the Google/Nest ecosystem. I really wanted this to work. Troubleshooting my 2nd generation Chromecast I finally gave up, it was a nightmare. I bought this Gen 3 Chromecast in the hopes that it would fix my reliability issues. It has not but now I have introduced entirely new failure modes, so that's fun. I've had a sophisticated friend helping me and neither of us can get this to work reliably. My wifi is Google mesh and I'm casting from a Pixel 5. It's all Google so you would think it would work together. We've tried assigning static IP address etc, etc. All the things we can find on the forums. While casting with YouTube or Netflix it freezes periodically and will only play for 2-3 seconds with each push of the play button. Sometimes it returns to the YouTube TV home screen in the middle of a video. Sometimes it does even weirder stuff.

"Sketchy at best","I bought this to stream thru my projectorThis thing is useless w 5.1 audio and many apps wont let you turn off the 5.1Endless audio sync problems w apps. Amazon Prime make sure turn off the Digital Dolby otherwise you will have audio out of sync. Works beautiful when its offOnly works w Disney Plus if you turn on the audio w description which forces it into stereo when you cast Disney it forces you into Dolby 5.1 which then causes audio sync issues. Every video I have tried on Disney is pushed into whatever 5.1 they have and you have zero options to turn it off the only work around is audio w description the everything is fine but you have a narration that destroys any hope of enjoying anythingHulu if the show or movie doesn't have dolby 5.1 your fine... the older shows and movies Elementary Star Trek Angel etcTill I tried newer shows like Stumptown and Orville the audio is out of sync unless you turn on on audio w description which forces it into stereo. I cant explain thisZero problems w youtube I don't have NetflixThe bonus is you can stream Chrome browser stuff from a desktop or stream from VLC sometimes there's no rhyme or reason why one file plays fine and one will only play the audio.Another issue is Hulu and Disney plus get weird w the app the control is lacking and aggravating Amazon Prime is the opposite total ease of useSo I either have to invest into hdmi audio splitter to essentially downgrade the audio into 2 channel stereo since there isnt an option within chromecast or the ios app doesn't have this feature and hope that works or just buy a different stickReally irritated that this thing doesn't live up to the hypeRead up on all of the audio sync problems before you buy this personally I think its crap and doesn't deliver","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2020","Sean O’Deli",344

This one I purchased 12/21, it's just 3 months in use and has been steadily dropping streams. Needless to my wife and I & our standing Friday night ""datenight"" of over 20 years will shift gears, tonight I'll grab a book, read a few chapters or more and enjoy her opinion(s) concurring or not with mine. And why don't I use one of the older chromecast units...I shouldn't have to. Disconnect, reconnect, setup. On an on, ect., ect. Again I'm disappointed, I expected better.

I set it up easily and then wanted to take it to someone else's house and use it for a day. In order for it to go thru the wireless setup again you have to press this little unmarked button on the side of the device and hold it till the light is on solid (don't remember the color but it takes about 5 seconds). Then you can use your phone to configure.

Ability to cast/mirror screen from any iPhone device (not supported)3. Ability to control sound output format (settings removed on latest release)If you happen to find yourself in the middle of a pandemic and need to take calls on your TV using any social media or meeting app (including meet.google.com), skip this product or get yourself an additional speaker because Chromecast cannot patch audio from these.

However it took me about 1/2 hour to figure out how to add it under the control of my phone. While the instruction was written in orderly fashion that made it clear to follow, there are steps not clear enough to make the installation a smooth one. But once connected, the quality of the pictures are almost as good as original but small resolution are lost. Also there are different video players compatible with Chromcast such that with one click, the picture gets redirected to the TV.

"Great When it Works","The quality of the streaming is good, but I quite often have difficulty casting to my TV with this device. I've had to reset the device multiple times when streaming Netflix since half the time it freezes up and my phone says it is unable to connect. When streaming Disney+, it'll connect but the controls won't work from the phone. It is as if it sent the signal to start casting but after it starts, it losses connection with the streaming device. I've tried resetting both the device and my phone multiple times and it is plugged in to the wall for power through the USB adapter, but I still continue to have these issues. I've only streamed from a laptop top about two times but didn't seem to have any problems this way, so just know, if you tried to stream from a mobile device, you may have trouble. If you can get it to work consistently, it's a great device with great streaming quality, but sadly while the issue continue I can only give it three stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2021","Michelle Scoggins",360

"Get Roku instead for $29.00","No support m…I gave up as it was constantly going wonky and did not have settings menus to fix anything!. Even Apple spent more time trying to help me try to get Apple TV+ app to stream, when Google’s help site was just well, screwing with me. They know they aren’t supporting users. They think “let’s get the community to do the work” but the product controls are so vapid it is impossible to “commune” on its use. To me, it is arrogant to put a product out to consumers that lacks any kind of menu, reasonable help files, nor reliable setup approaches. It wastes people’s time. A bunch of developers with big heads that confuse their desire to be technically elite with the reality that they are not delivering an elite experience. They are delivering white noise. Like a blank canvas parading as modern art. The Emporer’s New Clothes. No menu. No help. A lot of nothing posing as something. I returned it and got a Roku 4K for 29.00 at Staples and what a difference. It practically set itself up. It worked. Also supports Apple TV+ which Chromecast does not. And there is no need to stream from another device. Roku makes your TV into a smart tv, has a remote that sync so you can operate the tv or stream, and it knows to switch inputs on its own without being told. You no longer need your phone to stream. You get a huge menu of apps. It is far superior. Makes Chromecast look like a hack.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2022","CollegeMom2",368

That's it, and that won't work for me. I have elderly relatives and also a child who visit my home regularly and also like to watch Netflix, and need to be able to do so without a smartphone.

"Frustrating until it feels like cooperating","I had an older version of this that you could plug into the TV, and the problem was it would always randomly disconnect while playing something- no excuse, not because of wifi or the tv/playstation itself, just because it was old. So I bought this updated version, and while I appreciate it for working differently than the other TV connection devices (roku, apple, etc) far as ease and not needing a remote, it still gives me problems where every time I turn my TV off after using it, I have to unplug to reset it when I want to turn it back on- instead of it just acting normal. It's a major inconvenience if EVERY time I want to use it, it pretends like it doesn't exist (on my laptop) until I go behind the TV and reconnect it, which should've only been a thing to do the very first time I installed. Had it for 2 months now and it honestly pisses me off every time. Would return and give in to the other ones, but return window is up.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2019","Jasmine",377

The management of the unit is not customer friendly. ( I can deal with this if the disconnect problem can be solved.I have done some research on the net to try and fix the disconnect problem.3. I have refreshed it, reinstalled it and so far that has not resolved the random disconnect. I made an adjustment to Chrome settings today I'll see if that helps. This a candidate for return if I can't fix the random disconnect problem, I have until 21 Sept to do this and a few more days of this problem will result in a return way before the deadline.Update: Nothing seems to stop it from randomly disconnecting, I am returning it.

You have to download the Google Home app during setup to be able to connect your phone to your new chromecast and I believe you need to have wifi (I could be wrong) in order for everything to connect..

"does what it says it does, but there is no way to turn it off, making it useless for my monitor","The chromecast works as expected, but ended up being nearly completely useless for my use case.There is no way to turn the chromecast off. When its not streaming, it goes in ""Ambient"" mode, which means streaming a slideshow of pictures. THERE IS NO WAY TO DISABLE AMBIENT MODE. thats right, your chromecast, from the second you plug it in, will be using your bandwidth to stream a slideshow to your TV EVEN WHEN YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT IT. Short of unplugging it after you're done watching it, it will be considered an ""active"" input on your TV/monitor.This is where my usecase fails. I have mine plugged into my monitor, and I want to stream content, then when i'm done I want my monitor to automatically go to sleep when it detects that my chromecast is now ""inactive"", just like it does when my laptop goes to sleep. However, since there is no way to disable ambient mode, the chromecast is active forever and I have to get up and turn off my monitor or unplug the chromecast when I want to go to bed.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2020","Max",387

"Inconsistent & Poorly Maintained","Chromecast is simple to use. We occasionally purchase these as a gifts for friends and family. However, it can be buggy for months at a time. The most resent issue has made the device unusable for our most commonly used streaming service, YouTube.If connecting YouTube via Chromecast with an Android device, the connection will not last through the first video.*Solution: find an old iPhone/iPad and add your play list. For whatever reason that connection is more stable.**Presently the issue is significantly less pronounced when using steaming services other than YouTube.***This issue or others like it have been present since we purchased our first Chromecast seven years ago.****We are curious if a Kindle Fire is a better solution but will likely stick with what we have because my husband is not a fan of the bald oligarch who doesn't pay taxes.

Voice commands through the google home work for Netflix but not for Amazon prime.Only glitch so far is that it would randomly turn on the tv in the middle of the night at full volume and scare my soul out of my body.What i dont like is that as long as it is powered on, you cant have a black screen (like the TV turned off). It just keeps showing images as a screensaver, so I have to turn off the tv and then wait for the chromecast to load every time i turn it back on. Minor, but annoying.Its cool if you dont want to hire a cable service and are already subscribed to streaming services.

We decided to but a new version and once everything was set up, we noticed it would constantly lose connection and restart everytime we streamed anything. Constantly. I got online and it seems to be a huge issue for MANY other people as well. It makes this product virtually useless. There needs to be a firmware update or something to fix it.

"Returned it. Worthless to me. Was Replacing a 1st Generation Chromecast... DONE with Chromecast.","UPDATE: Returned it, glad I got it through Amazon. AMAZON, you make returns certain and painless, and this is why I shop online almost exclusively with YOU. Previous post: We have good Cable signal, plenty of bandwith. New Orbi system, with noting else running. Was trying to Cast shows, and sound and video would glitch/hiccup with my old, 1st Generation Chromecast. Was running fine on Computer, but glitching on TV/Chromecast. Replaced with the 3Gen Chromecast. No better. PLUS, and this torques me: Chromecast wont install on my Windows computer. Have to install the modern Chromecast app on a Phone. The OLD App, on my computer, wont work with the New Chromecast. So, maybe I say to heck with Chromecast PERIOD.

This doesn't work at all for two reasons: there is a very noticeable lag so interactive use is just awful, and the cast image is somewhat poor quality, rendering a large screen sort of useless. I am using the desktop cast feature in the Chrome browser. I will edit this if I find a fix.As a replacement for my Roku in watching TV I guess it would probably be great, but for mirroring a laptop it's just bad.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2019","awsome me",424

"Do not buy this","Do NOT buy this garbage. I have purchased 2 Google home devices and 3 chromecast devices and four out of 5 of them have proven defective. Google should stick to software and search engines because their hardware products are absolute garbage. We had trouble connecting these devices to wifi initially and once they were connected more problems started. We returned the ones we could. Do yourself a favor and buy any other streaming TV device that isn't made by the Google brand. Get a tivo or roku. Anything but chromecast. Get a fire stick. We only bought it because it was supposed to support the spectrum tv app where roku and fire do not, but it has become a useless device in my house that does nothing. I have followed all the troubleshooting steps on the Google Chromecast help page and all of their suggestions have failed. All I have left to do is the frustration of calling their customer service number in hopes of resolution or trying to return this defective piece of garbage to Amazon. Hopefully one of these resolutions works.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2021","Brian Olsen",426

"Before you buy","To be Frank this is probably the worst streaming product out of the major brands. It lacks 4K HDR support. The advertising is a bit misleading about being able to Simply cast from your phone to your television. The Chromecast will not even connect to a network that does not have a dedicated internet connection. It is not a plug-in-play product with all of this setup required. It is comparatively a lower capacity product with fewer features and an overall less user-friendly experience.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2021","Gage",426

Chromecast is a very simple Smart TV system and it's great for people that are not as tech-savvy. You can also connect the Chromecast to a Google home speaker.

Specifically, with certain apps, I'll press the chromecast link and instead of playing on the screen automatically it stops the video and when I press play again it starts the video from the beginning instead of where I left off. Also, at times it randomly stops playing and i lose the chromecast display. It works enough for me to not return it, but it is annoying.

"Fails EVERY use case outside the most basic","This device managed to overwhelmingly fail in more situations than it succeeded, an incredible feat I have never experienced in a mainstream brand:1. Stream Twitch: GLITCHY - Microstutters every 5-10 seconds2. Mirror PC desktop: LAGGY - 1-2 second delay makes mouse input borderline unusable3. Cast photos/videos from phone (using Google Photos on Google Pixel 2): FAIL - video sound did not work at all. photos take many seconds to ""unpixelate""4. Mirror Oculus VR: OK. Connection is finnicky, but does work5. Wifi compatibility: FAIL - Tried at brother's house, failed to connect to wifi at all.I can only imagine what all the 5-star reviewers are doing with their Chromecasts -- maybe the most popular streaming apps like Netflix/HBO/etc are working correctly?Background: I have a strong tech background and these are all networks that have had zero problems with other devices and apps. We tried two different Chromecast devices, same results.Further rants: Google has aggressively pushed Google Cast to replace e.g. Samsung's support of Miracast in their Android phones, to the point of dropping Miracast entirely. The irony is that Miracast, despite its flaws, actually worked for many of the above use cases. This entire situation reflects very poorly on Google's attitudes towards its customers (a.k.a guinea pigs) and has been strong motivation to switch to iPhone/AirPlay","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2020","Barry",435

And as for the apps, most developers have given up trying to rewrite their apps to keep up with Chrome updates. And these are very finicky. Without an EXACT amount of power going to these, they start to act up. And they wear out quickly.

"Like resetting it daily! Google wifi devices are not maintenance free! Not for security cameras!","Google home and its products are a great toy, but that's about it! ALL THE NEW GOOGLE NEST WIFI PRODUCTS WILL LOSE NETWORK CONNECTIVITY AND REQUIRE REGULAR USER INTERVENTION TO MAINTIAN CONECTIVITY! I have over 30 years experience as a computer and electrical engineer and design microcontroller system. So I have some technical knowledge. My home is already automated by my own built systems, but I wanted to try out the Google Home and Nest products for family members. I CAN NOT RECOMEND IT! Google is going backwards with their new ""Nest"" technology. Instead of trying to making it simpler, they are making it utterly useless. It is still a couple years away from being a reliable and usable system. I wasted well over $1000 trying to give the Nest product line a decent review over the last month. I am disgustingly disappointed. All of the new Google wifi products have a reputation of bad network management and refuse to automatically reestablish a connection when lost. All of the Nest products require user intervention just to keep them connected and working. It's almost a daily chore now to figure out what devices dropped off the network and to get them reconnected. Older google products, BEFORE Nest, have not experienced any wifi failures. Such as the original google thermostat. I have it mounted in a detached garage over 50 feet away with the worst wifi signal and it has no problem staying connected, as long as it is NOT on the ""Google Nest wifi"" network. All the newer Google products, such as the Chromcast, Nest Learning Thermostat, Nest Wifi, Google Hub Max, Nest Hello, and the Nest Yale lock all have issues with network connectivity, with and without the Google Nest Wifi. I only experience network loss with the Nest product line. No other wifi device in my home experiences network connectivity issues, as long as it's not on the Nest Wifi. Even my Android phone tells me it is switching over to cell service because the Nest wifi can not reach the internet when I am 5 feet from the router, meanwhile my tablets on my Cisco or netgear routers stay connected. The Google Hub Max is 10 feet from the Google Nest Wifi router and drops connection at least once a day. The Max Hub is the only device that I have witnessed attempting a reconnection. All the other devices do not even show an attempt to reconnect in the router network logs. It's as if the Nest devices were powered down but they are all on, alive and still disconnected. I have a few chromecast's installed within 5 feet of a Nest wifi point which is 25 feet from the router and they all have a strong wifi signal and they still loose connection separately. The Chromcast and the Google Hub display CAN NOT reliably stream live security cameras! It keeps popping up with the on screen player controls, for a live stream that has no control, that blacks out the bottom half of the screen for up to 10 seconds making the video useless. Since both of the devices operate on Wifi if there is any packet loss you are stuck looking at the player controls indefinably, making the video completely useless. All the newer Nest products loose wifi connection at least once a week at random and individually, it's almost never any 2 devices on the same wifi point unless the wifi point itself failed. It is not the wifi network because I have tried 3 different wifi router systems on nearly every wifi channel with the same results. I even used 2 different RF spectrum analyzers to make sure I do not have any stray RF signals interrupting the wifi signals. If it says ""Google Nest"" on the product be ready for daily network maintenance!","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2021","Delirious Intentions",439

I redid everything and it worked for about two minutes and then the TV screen went black and it never worked again. I’ve tried searching the Internet for troubleshooting And I found several others complained that they had the same problems. I also noticed there was about a five second lag between what I could hear in the headset and what came across the TV it was almost like an echo.

I can hardly ever get it to connect to my phone which isn't even a year old and all I seem to be able to do with it is cast from my phone to the TV. I can do that with out this device so I don't really know what good it is. Everytime I go to google to trouble shoot or get help, what's on their website is of no help what's so ever.

"Mirror your phone screen videos have a low frame rate.","Right out of the box. The setup was pretty easy. Plug in, download the app, and connect to it. First time casting to the screen was fine. After that is where things started to sour. The quality of my phones home screen on the TV was horrendous but I continued and started playing home videos. The more it played the worse the frame rate got after 15 minutes it was so bad it couldn't keep up with what my phones screen had on so I disconnected my phone from it. Looking at the help support it says my phone (Moto z4) wasn't on the optimized phones list for Casting but my old phone was (Moto z2 play) So I test it out and couldn't get it connect. After messing with it for 30 mins or so I finally got it to connect again but still had the same issues frame rate and picture quality are bad the longer you use it. Until it gets to a point where it freezes. It felt hot like it was overheating.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2019","Cameron M.",465

It will not play your private videos in many formats but makes up for this shortcoming by allowing you to watch free straight to video movies on sights that show ads. The few free sites that work with Chromecast, anyway. Maybe it works better with the pay channels?

"Needs internet. Even for screen cast.","Kind of stupid design. I primarily wanted it to screencast. I'm not paying for internet so I thought it would be fun to cast videos from my phone to my TV. However the way this thing is designed it needs internet. Basically it runs off of its own apps. So it's not really mirroring your device it's just using your device as credentials to log into that application on the Chromecast and display it on the tv. Meaning that if you don't have internet or router you can't even cash to your TV screen. Which is really stupid design because that's all I wanted.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2021","Mary King",470

"Useless","I bought this because my laptop's HDMI port doesn't work—what a mistake!The stream quality is atrocious. It's like watching a YouTube video in 2007. The resolution drops off a cliff from your computer to the TV, and the framerate goes up and down, at some points freezing a single frame onto the TV for several seconds.Theoretically you should be able to improve the picture quality by streaming a *file* instead of your computer screen to the TV, but only files that are natively supported in Google Chrome can be streamed, and this excludes such ""rare"" filetypes as .mkv. I tried several Chrome extensions and other methods to get around this, but sure enough, Chrome thwarted me at every turn.If at all possible, please just buy an HDMI cord.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2020","Amazon Customer",480

"Not a very simple product to use.","My MacBook is updated to the latest OS, but I still do not have Airplay, so this sounded like an easy system to let me show my pictures onto my new 50 inch television. The product description specifically lists Vizio as applicable. And it lists my MacBook as applicable. I just spent two hours trying to get this to work, first following eh directions that came with the device (useless) and then trying different online columns (again, useless). as usual, these devices simply do not work for me and directions can be followed to the absolute 't' and still not work for me. I can plug in an HDMI cable and do this, but I want to do things while sitting on my sofa ten feet away and not be bound by a cable. This device says it will do it, but will not.

"Unreliable and frustrating","When it works, it works great. Fantastic picture and quick connection. But that’s about 30% of the time. The remainder of the time it constantly disconnects from either the streaming device (phone or chromebook) or the WiFi. An error message shows up and next thing you know, it’s asking you to set it up as a “new chromecast device.” I just wish it was less glitchy because it’s wonderful when it’s working.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2019","Ellie DiCristofaro",499

"Can’t get it to work","I cannot get this item to work on any TV that I have. My daughter has a Chromecast with remote and it works great. I wish I’d gotten one of those instead. This one appears to need Google home and the set up doesn’t work for me.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2022","Ydnicuol",499
"Junk","I'm in cancer treatment with only a few channels on the tv and thought this would be a good thing to use. It can't even connect to the building's unsecured, public wifi. I can only use it by turning on my phone's hotspot and burning my data.It's just a hunk of junk hanging on the back of the tv. Rabbit ears with foil on them would work better than this stupid thing.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2022","Astor Teufel",499

"Simple setup? Nothing could be further than the truth.","Plug in this to this and that, download this from here, ""cast"", and then what...start all over all...just marketing crud here.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2019","visualgirl",500

"Good with Mobile device but not working with Laptop","I was able to get my cell phone to connect to it. That's the good part.I updated my Browser (Chrome) and saw the device when choosing ""Cast"" but then it never worked.Is it only suppose to work with mobile phone? The instruction on the box only said about hooking up a mobile device.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2019","Peter WU",500

"Optimal devicess","Easily set up but during process it told me my device was not the best for this chromecast model. Initiating casting works flawlessly but I frequently lose the volume and must shut down and start again. I am using my Galaxy S9 phone . Unfortunately never saw suggestions for what devices would be optimal.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2020","pam",500

"Unable to connect","I've been trying for more than an hour to set up the Chromecast. I'm able to get until the very end, but then I get an error telling me that the Chromecast can't connect to the Wifi- this is after the Chromecast has already found the wifi.I've factory resetted the Chromecast 3 times which hasn't fixed anything and I've made sure access point isolation is turned off.Biggest waste of $35.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2020","Ryan Scherbatsky",500
