"New style remote.. otherwise it’s the same.","I don’t write reviews often, but I learned a few tricks that solved issues I’ve had over the years. I hope this helps others with seemingly unsolved issues with firesticks.Firstly I’ve been using firesticks even before 4K TVs and they’ve almost always have worked well. The occasional restart/reboot on older models were something my family got used to. I eventually replaced all older units with this 4K version. And now never have to reboot. Although this has slightly better remote function, it’s essentially the same as the 2018/2019 version. The 4K Max has the spec bump and quicker less congested WiFi 6 configurations.Okay, so my biggest gripe with the firestick had to do with it not always playing HDR or Dolby Vision, which defeats the purpose of it being a 4K model. I’ve scoured tons of forums and looked at countless YouTube videos regarding this. But either the solutions didn’t work, or they would only be HDR 10 when the nicer Dolby Vision was available.SOLUTION: Make sure your 4K tv setting are set properly. Go into “INPUT” settings and find the HDMI input you’re using for the firestick and depending on your model make sure “UHD” is toggled on. This solution finally allowed every content I’ve played on all streaming services to finally play Dolby Vision content (and HDR when DV was not) every single time. I hope this helps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2021","Ben U.",1
"Faster than old stick","The positive:This new generaion fire stick is faster than our old stick. The old one has struggled with the new major update Amazon did and the buttons were worn. The updated processor and increased memory helps.It is really nice having the volume controls on the remote. The two batteries load in a more traditional way as well.The negative:I really wish they made the four quick buttons on the bottom programmable. We ditched Disney + and would much rather have it pull up youTube, HMO Max, or Discorvery +. Oh well.I don't like the new update. I now have to go to the Amazon Prime app to see my purchased videos, where before it was built into the main menu. I also have zero interest in the live TV and believe that is what was dogging down the old Fire Stick. The ad space on top is also a lot bigger and when I search a movie it's not telling me if Netflix has it. I ended up purchasing a movie to watch that ended up being on Netflix.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2021","Laura",1

"Desperately needs an app only mode","This new 2021 interface that Amazon pushed to all its devices makes the device near impossible to set up for a parent or older person. There’s no way I can explain that 90% of the screen is an ad to my elderly parents. At least with the old interface, the recent app row was above the ads. Now there’s a banner ad and a suggested row before getting to the large app icons that they can actually see.Outside of a 3rd party launcher, there’s no way to make this usable for someone that doesn’t understand technology. Luckily the new googletv interface offers an app only mode. That’ll be my go to from now on. A once great eco system of FireTV devices is now more ads than function.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2021","Dan",1
"Works fine. New buttons work. A bit faster. So far no WiFi 6","Upgrading from the ""old"" 4K Fire Stick which will go to my son. One star off for the ""WiFi 6"" capabilities as I have an ASUS RT-AX86U router with WiFi 6 and yet my new Firestick shows 5GHz with very good signal strength. It works fine and streams fine but I would like to see my FIRST WiFi 6 device showing that it is using all of that extra speed, heh. The boot-up, app boot, and remote are slighter faster. The navigation ring on the remote is a bit stiffer than the older one (does not butt change stuff when you sit on it tho!) The Netflix, Disney+, Prime buttons all work fine. Getting all the apps signed in AGAIN is a pain so I wished that would automatically get moved over with some sort of sync but it is a one-time pain.Full-time HDR and Dolby vision pops up on most stuff. Easy to connect to a network. Does 8 bit, 10 bit, and 12 bit HDR and is selectable. Audio sounds great but I just use stereo headphones so cannot tell much difference from the old oneShould you upgrade from the old Fire Stick to this new one? Nope if the old one works well. A little faster, probably better WiFi reception and some extra buttons are not worth it so far. I just needed another one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2021","John E. Pombrio",1
"Not user friendly","First off, delivery was quick and the driver was friendly and that is about all I can say that I enjoyed of this so far. The Firestick doesn't seem to want me to stream movies in full screen. I have a QLED TV and now I lost part of my screen with the firestick. Previews will be full screen but once you hit play, not full screen anymore. Don't have this problem with a Roku which is what I was replacing to get an upgrade I thought. Can't log into AMC+ with your existing account, it will make you setup a new account and pay double the money. I already paid for a year and will use my existing one. Amazon seems to be acting like Apple and want to control the apps and where you spend the money. My next move is to return this and get the latest Roku 4k stick. I have tried all the online fixes that were suggested and problems have persisted.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2021","Darrian Turner",1
"Doesn’t work with Disney+","I bought this because it has a quick button for the exact 4 streaming services I subscribe to watch. It works great with all except for Disney+… it won’t connect and I’ve tried everything. Very disappointing and I’m not the first one with this issue. It’s posted all over the internet. Just search “fire stick won’t connect to Disney+“ and you will see. I wish I would’ve searched it before I bought it, because I wouldn’t have bought it if I knew it has had this problem for YEARS. Not a happy customer. It’s been like this for days on my device and it seems like a permanent problem… I’ve tried everything and nothing is fixing the issue. You have been warned.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2021","Amazon Customer",1
"Arrived broken, after 3 hours talking to Amazon it's still not being replaced!!!","DO NOT BUY FIRE TV DEVICES!!! CHOOSE ANOTHER STREAMING PLAYER BRAND!!!Worst customer service experience in my life from Amazon!!!! Amazon sent me a completely broken Fire TV 4k stick! From day one the audio cuts out entirely after a few mins of playing a video, and does not return until stick is physically unplugged from power. Then it cuts out again. Problem occurs in all video apps, and I tried full software restore, plugging into multiple different TVs, as well as different audio connections (direct to TV through HDMI, Through receiver, through bluetooth on multiple devices.) And my other Fire TV 4k of the same model works fine in this same TV, so... THE STICK IS BROKEN! So I contact Amazon through their chat interface and Parmish is a total disaster at helping me. I tell him that I have done a full software restore on it, at which point he responds that I need to do a full software restore. Ya know, the thing I just told him that I did already. Then I tell him I have already tried plugging the fire TV directly into the TV with no sound receiver, and he says ""well than what I need you to do is plug the fire TV directly into the TV with no sound receiver."" This happened over and over. It was like a bad joke. But I wasn't laughing. Finally after about an hour of this nonsense he decides that my Fire TV stick needs to be replaced. Then he says I ""Have no card on file"", what ever that means. So after about 10 more unanswered and ignored questions to him about just what he's talking about I finally figure out he means my Amazon account has no credit card on file. But it does have a card on file. I log in and verify this. The card is up to date and working, and amazon had just charged it that day even. So I tell him this, and he responds that I need a credit card on file in order to send out a replacement, even though it won't be charged. I tell him again that the card is on file and working, and he says it need to be updated. Even though it does not. So I hit ""edit"" on my card info on file, and resubmit the same working card. Parmish sees this on his end and says thank you. Then he says I need to update my OTHER CARD on file. I look and there is an old credit card from 6 years ago on the account from a bank I no longer use, and its not even selected as the active/favored card, so It doesn't even matter that it there, but I delete it anyways just to be sure. Then Parmish says I need to reenter and update that old card (that I no longer bank with) in order to get a replacement sent out. At this point I'm done with Parmish. The whole conversation was absolutely ridiculous! I say ""thank you for the help but I need a supervisor. Please transfer me to a supervisor.""So Parmish transfers me to Vikas. I ask Vikas if he is a supervisor and he says ""no."" (Are you surprised by this? I wasn't.) So I explain that I was suppose to be transferred to a supervisor and ask that Vikas transfer me directly to a supervisor. And I'm transferred to Annal.I ask Annal if they are a supervisor, and they answer... get ready for it... are you ready... they answer ...""No"" !!!!!!!!! They &^^&%&$^^%^ answer ""No.""So I close the chat window I just wasted over an hour on and I call Amazon. This is where the real nightmare begins. I start off with a regular customer service rep and I ask her to transfer me to a supervisor right away because this will be my 4th attempt to get a supervisor. She is very polite and gets me a supervisor on the line write away. I explain the entire issue with the Fire Tv 4k Stick and everything I have done to troubleshoot it already YET AGIAN, and the supervisor apologizes for all the insane trouble I've been having. She sounds like she really wants to help me, asked some more questions, and then tells me that she can't replace this particular model because its out of stock. I had just checked the stock, so I knew it wasn't out. I checked it again, and then told her it appears to have plenty of stock. She verified what model it was again, then said ""oh yes, I guess we do have it, let my put you on hold while I try to send you one."" She comes back a while later and says ""the system won't let me send you one. I have to transfer you to a Fire TV Specialist, buy I'll get you a manager there as well.So then I have to go through the whole thing again with this new Fire TV Specialist person. She keeps putting me on hold to check things over and over again. And she has me do crazy things - For example, she insists I go to my TV, unplug the other working Fire TV I now have in there, and plug this broken one back in, then load it up and read the serial number off of it to her from the info screen. Why? Doesn't she already have that info? She should. And WHY AM I PLUGGING A $25 DEFECTIVE BROKEN DEVICE BACK INTO MY $2,000 FLATSCREEN??!!! I don't want to do that. I shouldn't be asked to do that. What the hell? Then she keeps checking to see if I'm still in warranty. REALL???!!! I JUST got this stick in the mail. I JUST GOT IT. How long is the warranty period that she has to keep checking on.. 5 hours after purchase. Also, this is a brand new model that just came out. HOW COULD ANY OF THEM POSSIBLY BE OUT OF WARRANTY??!!Finally after 3 HOURS of talking to people about this and a final, particularly long hold while the Fire TV Specialist person tries to figure out if I can be sent a replacement - I give up. I tell her I'll just return it instead - just so I can just get off the phone. But I'm NOT returning it - That too would probably turn into another huge nightmare. It's not worth my $25 for all this aggravation. So... I'M DONE. This is ridiculous! After speaking with a total of SIX people for over THREE HOURS.. My brand new Fire TV 4K stick in now in my trash can and I'm never buying a Fire TV product again. All Amazon need to do was have me send in my broken one and then send out a replacement. That's It. They could have sorted out all their serial numbers and insane data requirements after they got my stick back. AS a customer, I simply got something in the mail that arrived broken and I wanted it replaced soon after I got it. How simple of a transition is that? But instead I got this torrent of poor customer service and bizarre data mining. SO.. Officially.. I'm no longer a Fire TV user.I'm currently switching my entire smart TV ecosystem for the entire house over to Google's Android TV now, I've had it with Fire TV, and I suggest you do the same. Android TV systems don't suffer from the same app limitations that Amazon does (IE with Fire TV you get access got about 12% of the Android apps available to the rest of the Android TV world, Even though Fire TV runs on Android, and you can install what ever apps you want on your Android TV device without having to TRICK IT into installing it), it still works and runs apps (like playing a game or looking at photos) even if your internet connection goes down (Fire TV becomes a useless brick without constant internet), and the whole thing just seems to run better. I don't have time to deal with Amazon's nightmare anymore. All I needed was for Amazon to replace the broken Fire TV stick they JUST sent me, and they can't even do that. So, ummmm...

"Excellent","This is my first time buying a Firestick and I'm glad I purchased it. It was pretty easy to set up and the picture quality is great on my hd tv ( I don't have a 4K model). Lots of content it will take me some time to explore all of it. The only minor problem I had was initially getting the battery compartment open on the remote. I had to google to find out the proper way to open it. After that it was smooth sailing getting it set up. I would highly recommend this new Firestick it works great. You don't need a 4K tv to operate this stick all you need is a tv with hdmi ports. Give it a try you'll like it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2021","Dee K.",2
"Failure!","I've been using Fire Sticks for years. Each new generation seems to become a piece of junk in days. I've had this new one for a few days, got all my activation's set up (again). Now I have to unplug and restart this stupid stick 8-10 times a day, very frustrating. Every other time I try to return to home screen all I get is black screen, plus half the time the mute function does work without restarting stick.

"Product doesn't match photos","The media could not be loaded.
 Update: I've been sold a dud. Can't get past the initial fire tv logo. Goes to a blank screen and nothing happens (see attached video). For reference my older FireTV is connected to the same TV without issue. I've tried this new FireTV in the same HDMI port and on the ports of other TVs and still nada. Also tried solutions via Google. Wasted money as I'm not in the US anymore. One star.

I ordered the fire tv stick 4k due to the photos indicating that the remote came with buttons for Netflix, Disney+, etc. However as seen from my photo, it's just the normal remote. For that I'm giving it 2 stars for the deception.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2021","Fox",2
"Hey, It's a Firestick - None Better","This is the third Firestick I have bought and I love them all - I wanted one in the living room and bedroom because air TV is terrible in my area. Also take one on my travel trailer. They only need a TV with an HDMI slot, a nearby electric plug (some work on USB) and a decent WiFi signal. If you can't get WiFi, the Firestick is not for you. It opens up a world of possibilities for what to watch. Works well with Amazon Prime, Hulu, YouTube TV, and many other subscription carriers for much less than satellite or cable. Installation is easy and working the remote is simple.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2021","Ben Henry",2
"Poor performance after upgrades","When the firesticks are first released they work fairly well, than the system updates come which eat away at the performance until the stick is almost useless because of how slow the interface is to respond. Amazon has now made it impossible to downgrade the Firesticks to previous versions by adding eFuses to the circuitry, so you can't even flash back to a previous version. My firestick after the last update now struggles to even run Pandora, and forget about it running Plex or anything that will take up more resources like that. I feel like the Firesticks are put out there to get you to eventually buy the Fire Cubes which have far better performance.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2021","Paul A.

"None of the firesticks have 8gb false advertisement","The media could not be loaded.
 Now don't get me wrong love the firestick great device issue is storage and the way its advertised this device should have 8gb of storage and 1.5 memory pre installed apps and updates is gonna reduce it to 3.85 gb and that's what's left of the 5.43gb you actually have. I would appreciate if amazon gave me a device that actually has 8gb with 1.5 memory. I understand you can add external storage that's not the issue so let's make sure we stay on the issue. When you buy a phone or whatever and it's advertised as having 256gb storage when you look the it say 256gb storage. I would like amazon to do right by me now I will do a correct review on the product. Also Alexa never picks up what I say I end up typing it in. Right now Amazon has not resolved my issue. Next issue I had was connectivity every so often thi thing would disconnect and say no service I had to separate my router from auto to show 5gz and 2.4ghz and connect it to 2.4ghz directly in order for it to not have issues.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2022","mr. williams",2
"Great value and price. Easy to install and use. A must have!","I dont know why I've waited all these years to get a Amazon Fire stick? I've had Amazon prime ( plus Netflix and Hulu for many years and recently added HBOMAX ).I've been using my Xbox360 and XboxOne to stream my media up untill now. It only took minutes to install and once I downloaded all my apps and logged in to my accounts and was easily accessing all my digital media. The picture quality is great, I'm using a older Samsung TV but it works with the 4K new firestick no problem. Easy to use remote controller. The sound is quieter using some of my apps compared to using my xbox but I will solve this by buying a small soundbar. I installed 5 of these on all my parents televisions and they are not tech friendly people but they love their firesticks and are using them now instead of cable TV boxes. I highly recommend this.

"Capable Streamer. Grab one when deeply discounted","I had an older 4K firestick that appears identical to this one except for the remote. But this one is MUCH faster in terms of on screen use. Very snappy performance. Picture quality is very good too once you turn OFF the always on HDR, which will turn the picture to mud. It's on by default for some reason. Also make sure 4K is turned on (or auto) if you have a 4K set... Which presumably you do since there is no reason to buy this Fire Stick if you don't. Is it worth $50? No, but for half that price, heck yeah. And with a new 4K stick coming soon, discounts like that are probably going to be common...so cash in when you can.This probably checks every box you have. 4K. Dolby Vision. all forms of HDR, a voice remote with buttons that controls all essential TV functions (volume, channel, mute) with dedicated Netflix, Amazon, Disney+ and Hulu buttons...So if you have an older stick, and a newer 4K Dolby Vision set, going to this stick is a no brainer.The only downside is you have to download all your streaming service apps again, digging out the names and passwords of each one. A major pain. Amazon keeps track of everything else, including your wi-fi network, so not sure why it cant do this too. But it does not for some reason, despite a step in the setup process that sort of implies it does. If so, that process did not work for me.I know the new version of this stick is upgraded, supports WIFI 6 (which I have) and Atmos (which I don't) But can't see its worth twice the price of this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2021","DaytonaDan",3

"Unit sets up in a snap","Had a fire tv from 5 years ago and Hulu and it didn't play nice so got the stick. Installed it per the little get started sheet and it asked if the Tv was a Sony, was the sound bar a Sony, and then it installed itself. Right from the get go the remote worked the TV the stick and the sound bar all turned on or off with just the remote. It streams lots of things in 4K much to my surprise and it looks really great. It handles the sound well also. Amazon recommends hooking it to an HDMI/ARC. I hooked it to the sound bar which then runs to the TV and into an ARC HDMI port. Hulu live plays nice with it and Hulu live didn't work on the Ruko device I tried before getting the stick at half the price.

"Worth every penny, but buy it on one of their frequent sales.","I have 2 of these now, so I don't have to deal with my kid swiping the one from our living room TV. My 60"" Sony is a first generation LED, and has a few smart features, but no streaming services, etc. So the Firestick, with all of its features, suited my needs perfectly. I picked up the 4k on sale, cheaper than the standard one was the first time around. Second time around, it was about the same price, with a sale price, and some credit I had from something. The only issue I have had, is a remote died on the first one I had. It stopped working, except the volume controls. It was about 3-4 years old, and fairly light use. No spills or hard drops, etc. Ordered a newer replacement remote, and the swap was mostly easy. I had to power off the Firestick a few times before it would recognize the new remote. We use ours for viewing, Amazon Prime content, Disney+, Funimation, Crunchyroll, HBOMax, and there is plenty of free or semi free content to stream as well. The Alexa part of it functions as you would expect.

"HUGE Improvement","I had an original fire stick and liked it well enough. It was getting a little laggy and started spending a good amount of time buffering. I was starting to get a bit frustrated with it. So I upgraded to the 4K. I couldn't be happier. No buffering and it loads channels considerably faster. I wished I had done this a long time ago. It used my existing profile and automatically imported all the streaming channels I was watching on the 1st gen fire stick. All I had to do was re-enter my log-in credentials.The voice recognition works well enough to open various channels, but doesn't do complex requests. You cannot, for instance, tell it to go to a particular show on a particular streaming service in one command (like I can with my Sony smart TV).I've also owned Roku streaming sticks in the past and I prefer the fire stick hands down.

"Our prior Fire TV Stick was almost perfect, but this generation is even better.","As I’ve said before in these pages, we’ve tried Apple TV, Roku and YouTube TV and without question, Fire TV beats them all for not just a much-appreciated array of FREE programming, but for the intuitive ease with which you can explore everything they have to offer. Memo to the other guys … simply offering an abundance of content in your platform is seriously worthless if you just throw it all in there with no thoughtful organization for your customers to follow - and to return to when we want to!!! Fire TV Stick does that very well.And fyi, I just bought the new Fire TV 4K Stick and was concerned whether my older TV (10+ yo SONY) and the new Stick would communicate.

"An improvement over my old FireTV","So after a couple years of use, I needed to upgrade my old FireTV stick (2nd Gen). It was running out of memory for the apps. Also the stick always glitched here and there because the processor was being stretched to it's limits. So I decided to upgrade to the 4K Fire TV Stick and was getting a discount that made the cost less than $25. Had this stick now for a couple months and I am very happy!What an improvement to start! Menu flowed faster, WIFI drops were non-existent and videos didn't lock up as before. That's because the CPU was improved (from an older Quad-Core 32bit that ran 1.3 to an improved CPU that runs at 1.8Ghz) and the memory is doubled (1GB to 2 GB). Did I mention there isn't a re-learning curve as the menu system is pretty much the same?The best thing, is the process to reload the apps from the one to the other is one shot. Unlike when you get a new computer and have to reload your programs or apps one at a time manually, the Fire Stick will do it for you when you attach it to your account. The only thing it didn't remember was the previous Stick's settings.Now with all that said, I did run into a problem.... the remote wouldn't program.

I purchased an Amazon 2 item special in 2018 and initially they worked well and then started failing to connect to Amazon Home network, which they must do first before they can function (guess all they show you is in the cloud). I wrote poor reviews on them, Amazon service was horrible, proved with a portable Roku (which I really don't like) that the internet service and TVs were not the problem.This device has very little connectivity issues and the Alexa voice on the remote works as well as before. I do like the voice and side app loading capability of the FireStick - think it's really the best device out there - if it works correctly.I have noticed in the last 30 days quite a bit of 'orange circle' streaming buffering. I've tested the TV again and also compared to a Roku TV on the same network, the network down is 526 mb (promised 500 with ATT) and the Amazon Firestick is the only device with buffering issues. Other than that, it updates automatically and regularly as promised, and worked great for many months until recently.Thinking as mentioned on a Bluetooth adapter review, that the way a Firestick works is to 'phone home' and connect up with the Amazon Cloud Firestick Home network before it does anything, I suspect that Amazon Web Service is having on-going issues and that's the cause of the buffering issue. Nothing else on my network has a buffering issue.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2022","Dave in Texarkana",4
"Great Upgrade from the non 4k Stick","My 3 year old Fire Stick was driving me crazy. I had to reboot it, on average,every 2 days. The voice would often get out of sync with the picture and there were many times when it would simply pout and not perform as intended. I got a notice about the 4k stick being on sale so I checked the reviews. I saw many people happy with the 4k stick and how most of the reboots, freezing and out of sync issues were corrected. I was somewhat skeptical but knew that I could return the stick if I was not happy with it. But happy with it I am!. After several weeks of use I have had no issues at all!. Great gui, flawless streaming, voice searches...everything works well!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2022","Joe. Silva",4
"I was so excited","My previous fire stick would play jeopardy on its on. Meaning I’d click the button on my app once and it would scroll mindlessly. My tv and stick were both handed down to me. Stick had a remote, but even with battery changes it just stopped working. Didn’t make sense to purchase a new remote, especially with the jeopardy scroll.Looking for the best deal, this was like $8 more than the lower version. Actually picked it up at target, same day hack with no min order for the win.Here’s the thing. I though I read everything good enough, but the buttons on the remote confused me. Yea I know I get it. Clearly + & - mean what they mean. But I was SOOOOOOO HAPPY, when I put 2&2 together and realized I now have a tv remote as well!First off. One remote will always be my preference. But to think “nawwww that’s not what it is” and it to actually be it. Man I was thrilled.Now my son can completely do everything on his own again. He’s 8, but with no remotes I had to use my phone to constantly change or click continue watching. He could handle going up to the tv and turning it up. Even better, now I don’t have to jump up in the middle of the night to turn the tv down because I forgot. Or stand and wait at the tv to see if the level is too loud, go back to the bed and check to see the level.Single mom, we share a room. This has been a very pleasant game changer!Everything works great!

"Surprising- Read on!","We bought the latest version of the 4K Fire TV Stick because we wore out our old one (especially the 'enter' key).We didn't expect much except getting another stick that worked fine. Instead my wife and I both noticed immediately that the picture on our TV was much better! Also it did not hang up as often with streaming. I attribute both these effects to faster and more sophisticated processors (and software) with each generation.Also there are new Apps which seem to be associated with the newest stick only. One which we use frequently is Amazon Music. That was yet another pleasant surprise.Well worth the upgrade even if you don't need to do it.

"Old Fire Stick remote failed again 3x so Finally upgraded- WOW!","My wife was blown away with how much clearer, brighter, and vivid the picture was once we installed this 4k Unit on our at least 7 year old 42"" TV. With an Amazon Show about 3' from the TV I don't know how much I need the Alexa button on the remote but I suppose if we want to be one step closer to Orwell's 1984 sure, why not...

"Great Addition To Any TV w/ Hi-Speed Internet","This newer version of the Fire TV Stick is faster than the 2nd Generation I have. It installed without a hitch & was up & running quickly. The addition of the 4 buttons at the bottom was a much welcome new feature. The only button of no use to me was Netflix. Thankfully, it was easily remapped & now pushing the Netflix button can launch any app I want. I chose KlowdTV. The remote is a bit slippery to hold so I'll be ordering a silicone case. It also does everything Alexa can do by talking to the remote & her response comes through the TV's audio system. For examle, you can pause the show you're watching to ask for a weather report, turn on a smart light or ask how old the actress is in the movie by just by pushing the remote's microphone button & making the request. Amazon Alexa devices also respond to commands to the Fire TV Stick after linking one or more. Pairing of the remote happened seamlessly. Pushing the power button on the remote turns on or off my Samsung TV & Yamaha receiver. I'm also using an older Samsung 50"" TV as a 2nd monitor on a PC in the basement. The FireTV remote can turn on the monitor & change the source HDMI port from PC to Fire Stick just by pushing the mic button & asking. Bottom line is that this a great device!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2022","darkNEskies",4
"Makes a Smart TV a Genius TV","This might give you the same feeling you had when you saw your first plasma tv! Even if you have a Smart TV, you can take your tv back to school because this Firestick brings a whole new level of knowledge. Once you see it, you won’t go back. Think of your current Smart TV as a CD player. It has a few apps (that may or may not buffer a little). This fire stick is the new digital music player that is clearer and has a ton of new capabilities; this is just with your video watching.The remote control will control all of your Alexa devices!But my favorite is simply turning the tv on and saying, “Alexa, turn on the Goldbergs in Hulu.” It’s like I’m back in the simple times of cable when you literally turned the tv on and turned it right to the channel you wanted to watch, but now you only use your voice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2021","Nate",4

"Work great on all of my subscriptions except Paramount +","This is my 3rd Fire Stick. They all work great except on Paramount + which I is the main reason I bought it. I thought being the newest model it might work on P+ when my older Fire Stick and Fire Box would not. I have 3 Samsung TVs and 4 Amazon Fire devices and Paramount Plus will not work on any of them The App installs and comes up. I can see all of the available shows. I pick one like Star Trek Discovery. Some background music and video comes up. I can open the Episode Menu but when I pick an episode it spins around a few seconds and says it needs an internet connection. It is like this no matter what show I pick on P+. From what I read this is a common problem with Fire Sticks and Samsung TV's. I have tried all of the fixes that I can find. I don't believe it is the fault of the Amazon Fire Stick. It works great on Netfilx, Disney+, Discovery + etc. There is one fix that I read where i have to change the DNS on the Fire Stick to match the DNS one on my router. That is a bit complicated and I should not have to do it and I don't even know if it will work. Paramount+ needs to fix their app. Has anyone else had this problem and found a positive soulution?","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2022","Okiejon",4
"FIRE TV STICK 4K IS FAB - CAN'T IMAGINE A HOUSE WITHOUT ONE!","We love our FIRE 4K TV Stick! Definitely faster than our older HD FIRE and the expanded collection of applications/content are just impressive. It lives happily in the back of our Yamaha AV receiver and within a few minutes of updates and re-authorizations of accounts - we were in business!Amazon makes a big deal of Alexa and voice navigation. We don't use it. Our hands and the remote short cuts are perfectly fine.Although we are an Apple household - there is nothing to compel me to spend 4X more for a marginal improvement in conveniece (Airplay screen sharing specifically). There are a number of work arounds, which are all satisfactory in our minds. However, tbh - Amazon could make this device more agnostic and make those of us who live in the Apple universe to be even happier.Lastly, we have found the video/audio quality of what we stream via the 4K Fire Stick to be great.Buy one and you will not regret it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2022","J.

"Impressed with user experience and value.","I bought this to fix my older Samsung TV's lack of speed when executing commands on native apps (esp HBOMAX). I was going to buy an Apple TV box, but decided it was too pricey.The Fire TV stick was the perfect solution and integrated seamlessly with my older TV. It was simple to set-up and use- plug, login, play, and go! The display quality is top notch, voice commands work flawlessly, and the app selection and ux fluidity are great. HBO Max works normally now as well. This little $35 device literally breathed new life into my older TV in a blink. I have to say I'm impressed on the value it delivers.I only have one element I'd improve, the plastic used on the controller doesn't feel as good to hold as smoother, polished plastic (as used on the control wheel).

"Fabulous! Saved me $500 or more! Read My Review","I have Fire Stick in my bedroom on my Sharp TV of about 10 or 12 years old. Firstly because the TV is only 48"" Sharp no longer supports this TV. I ran into a big issue on my fairly new living room 52"" Vizio. I am old school and spending $500 on a TV for me means I will have it in service longer than 10 years. Hulu recently changed something or upgraded so whatever they did would not work on my TV any longer, my Vizio. However that old Sharp TV is still running Hulu without issue. I quickly deduced that the Fire Stick was the difference between the two. I quickly ordered the Fire Stick for the Vizio in the living room. Thank you so much Amazon. I love my Fire Stick. I love the ease of my Alexa app I tell her to find a program for me and she does it. But most of all she just saved me $500 or more for a new TV. I am sure the FCC may come down on Hulu for this blocking us Old Schoolers from getting an app we pay for. A $25.00 investment saves me five hundred or more dollars.

"FireStik 4K","I had purchased Roku’s for my 5 TV’s in my house but then our city installed fiber throughout the city but Roku’s would not work with it. So I replaced all the Roku’s with the Fire Stick 4K. These have been working great with the new high speed service from our city and I haven’t had any issues with them other than finding channels that the city says we have access to through them but I can’t find. Not a Fire Stik issue though. What I really like about this product is that we use a sound bar with our large TV and I always had to turn on the sound bar separately but the Fire Stik recognized we had a sound bar and when I turn on the TV, it turns on the sound bar. Makes it easier. One thing I have noticed that I don’t know if it’s a provider issue or the Fire Stik but the TV commercials are significantly louder than the show making us mute the TV during commercials. Our previous product did not do this but we were also using Xfinity with them. Now I have 5 Roku’s that I need to do something with. Maybe put them on EBay or something because they are all nearly new. The Fire Stik 4K is a good product and is working well for us. Even though these are working well I kind of wished I had gone with Fire Stik 4K Max with WiFi6 for later upgrade to WiFi 6 but that’s later and there will probably be something better out there then.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2021","Scott Wilson",5

I did not enjoy using my phone as a remote with Chrome. Fire Stick comes with a nice little remote control, laid out fairly well, although a bit too light and small on big hand. The button placement makes sense and convenient along with the Voice control that works well.The app it’s self scrolls and operates quite seem less. Connect to all the various stream app services waa also easy to do, using your phone to basically verify the logins. I’m some cases as long as the phone is connected to your network and you open the app your wanting to connect on the Fire Stock, it will automatically detect this connection.Also access to new app based services for even more content if one would like to pay Amazon for these.

The stick has more than I was expected, not only was I able to throw HBO Max and Peacock on it right away, I found a CNBC app that I love and I just slapped Pandora on it. I’ll never have to switch my input to listen to music on our stereo system.

The PS4 is on it's last leg and sounds like a get engine and the Smart TV we have has a great picture, but it doesn't offer the same apps that the Fire TV offers, so I grabbed one of these as a cheap solution and way to watch our premium TV apps (HBO Go and Shotime) without them being drowned out by the PS4. It's a great solution for us since we don't need a new TV and a PS5 is still impossible to get. Added bonus is I love the interface for Spotify and watching podcast videos or having the lyrics on the tv while I clean is nice. It is faster than my 4 year old tv or PS4.

"What an improvement!","This was for our primary living room TV where we have limited wireless signal in spite of having a wifi booster just 20 feet away. Our streaming would buffer and/or pixelate periodically and even using the Prime home page was a battle. The basic fire stick we replaced was four years old and we figured all the problems were caused by the fact that we have 20+ other items sharing our bandwidth and the fire stick was just wearing out or inadequate for the available signal. So we decided to try the 4K one to see if it helped our streaming quality, and man did it ever!!! Every page and app snaps into place quickly and so far we haven't had even one instance of buffering during a movie or show. Love it!

"Easy set-up and like the TV controls","I have an older Samsung smart TV connected to a Samsung soundbar in a bedroom. I was using it only to stream content using the smart apps built into the TV. With the age of the TV the apps were no longer getting updates and were getting slow. I was using a Harmony remote to turn on the TV, switch to the apps menu and turn on the soundbar. Well, the Harmony support is going away too. (Old electronics!)This Fire TV Stick worked perfectly to update the TV.After simple set up, the power switch on the remote turns on the TV and soundbar then goes immeditately to all of the streaming apps that I want. The volume control works perfectly with the soundbar. The Alexa integration using the remote (pressing the blue button) works for selecting content but I haven't been able to have it control the power function.

Only the Samsung TVs worked in this configuration, although all devices worked when connecting the Firestick directly to the device's HDMI port. When I switched out the 4K splitter for a regular HDMI version, all devices worked.

"How to locate desired program content","works very well using Alexa because the sheer massive content of streaming is a bit overwhelming. The visual quality is outstanding and the selected channel is very high quality. The learning process to locate a specific streaming destination is a bit daunting until one gets used to it. The unit cost is unbelievably low so I expected a lower level of performance but no so, but with no reservations. Only time will speak to reliability but the unit appears to be well constructed and with Amazon backing a safe purchase.My cable bill dropped from $200 +, down to ~ $50 per month. Nuff said?.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2022","Harry Wert",7
"love this thing - ditch the cable company","I had no idea that I could do so much with this device by adding additional app and APKs. I had a Roku and I like this better for the most part. It's easier to use and easier to add apps, plus it's a lot cheaper. The one thing I like better about my Roku is that it had a jack for headphones so if I'm watching in bed, I can plug in my headphones and not disturb my husband. I wish Fire Stick could do this. The Quick buttons can't be changed which stinks since I don't use Disney+ or Hulu. Overall I am very happy with this FIrestick and hae purchased one for each of my TVs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2022","Aly B",7

"Happier than with the cube","My cube died, and Amazon blocked my return for credit, so I decided to try the cheaper option. The cube had some usability issues, so why not? The stick has proven to be far superior. With the microphone on the remote, it understands commands much better, with the downside of that being you must have the remote in your hand to use voice commands. The interface is fabulous and now I can see where I left off on many streaming services. Can create multiple profiles for Fire, which is versatile across multiple services. Switching between services is quick . Love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2021","Kindle Customer",7
"This has been a pleasant replacement for my old Fire TV stick","When our old bedroom Fire stick was requiring restart after restart I decided to bite the bullet and order a new device. As always, it arrived on time and was a breeze to set up.What I really like about this new device is that I can control the volume of my soundbar with the Fire Stick remote. No more searching for the soundbar remote when it needs a tweak up or down. I don't really use the app buttons too often. Honestly, they aren't very efficient and it'd not that hard to select one of those apps from the Home screen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2022","Jogster Heisenmeisel",7
"Plugged my Fire Stick into my… Fire TV.","I have an Insignia Fire TV that is lackluster to say the least. It’s slow, the remote is shoddy, Alexa integration is poor, there’s nearly no memory, nearly no storage (due to so, so much bloat). I restored it to factory defaults, logged out of Amazon on it, and set up this Fire Stick. It works as a TV remote for my Fire TV, and didn’t have any wonky effects as I thought there might be.Absolutely a night and day difference.Still a lot of bloat. Still a lot of ads. It’s not perfect, but it’s got over double the storage, and enough RAM to run a VPN, Kodi, and an IPTV, which is all I really use it for. If you use traditional streaming services (e.g. Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, etc.) you’ll be enthused.

The setup was so easy and worked seamlessly. They had extra dongles and wires to ensure everything fits. It remembers your prime info and saves you so much time setting up.Parental controls are built in super well and super quick to set up too. It lets you use profiles before you get into the actual streaming which is great when we don’t want our kids even to have access to Netflix or Hulu.The streaming integrations are great as well, gives you way more options than just selecting streaming apps. The Spotify integration is AMAZING.By far the BEST part is the fact that it set up volume with a sound bar about as seamless as possible and it can turn on and off your tv!

Checking the data monitor, the apps hardly use anything, but the firestick itself is using upwards of 75GB a week. Use turned off all push notifications, autopsy ads, and even reduced the playback quality to try to save some data usage, but it doesn't seem to help. I really love this, but I can't even watch one movie a night before reaching my data limit in the first 2 weeks, and I have 200gb of data through my phone company.

"Works great for a cheap solution. Awful interface.","Firestick's been around awhile, and it does stream well with great quality. The interface change Amazon made a year or two back is not as good as the interface used when the Firestick was first introduced. It lags horribly on all the sticks we have (4 of them), including this 4K stick, which is the most current. Interface is very clunky and poorly layed out. Also, no matter what settings I use, I can't keep it from going into 'Sleep' mode - even when setting the screensaver to 'Never'. It sure knows how to make sure it's advertisements run smoothly, though - even as the rest of the interface lags horribly and the app content SLOWly populates.

"Buffering issue still","Bottom line: The picture quality is great, the new remote and Alexa integration is almost seamless (it doesn’t like raspier voices). However the WiFi issues/ram still don’t allow the device to function consistently and sometimes not at all. When it works it’s great lolTo be clear the fire stick is my favorite device despite its issues, but I often reconsider this when the buffering issues still continue in every generation. This one is only a week old and it still happens.The reasons I know it’s the fire stick itself:Multiple devices in this house running at the same time to include 2 Rokus and an Apple TV and none have this issue at all—also to include the 6 computers used at the same time. None of the game 4 game systems lag either. I can literally use this side by side with the Roku and the fire stick will buffer and the Roku won’t and it doesn’t matter how many people are on the network at that time.The house is made up of IT contractors and gamers, we can’t function without a certain level of internet quality. You would have to move an entire office of computers into this home to max out the bandwidth.The isp is not throttling. It only occurs on the fire sticks in the house nothing else and it’s never during peak times.This issue occurs no matter what internet or house I use the fire stick in.You’d think by now the issue would resolve by this generation but unfortunately it hasn’t.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2021","Camijaee",15

Recently, both first generation firesticks stopped working after a software update. There were trade-in offers on amazon.com so I traded in both, one for a regular Firestick and another for the 4K version (hoping it would still be useful if I upgraded my TV). The regular Firestick works well but the 4K version shows error messages on both TVs (HDCP error). Apparently (upon web searches for this) it seems older TVs are not licensed to display 4K content due to the new HDCP Regulations. So even though my TVs are 720p and 1080p the signal doesn’t work and I had to return the 4K stick (losing my trade in discount in the process) and will have to wait to get it when I have a new TV.3 stars only because of the compatibility issue with older TVs but I am sure on a new TV this would be a 5 star device.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2021","JB",16

"Moved from Android TV box to Fire Stick","After spending the last 4-5 years on Android TV boxes (with mixed results), I finally broke down and tried the Fire Stick 4K. I'll not look back! I found the Fire Stick to be much more responsive to program launches, and incorporated ""live guide"" adds a nice touch when coupled with Pluto TV and YouTube TV. We were also able to install the Android apps that we had become accustomed to using on the TV box, and they ran flawlessly. The only hitch was the ability to use a mouse. After installing Mouse Toggle to allow for mouse clicks on some of the respective programs, all was well. Plenty of storage space if you're a streamer and not a downloader, plenty of 5GHz wifi speed (Speed test ~500Mbps), and plenty of power to run the apps we use.I saw several reviews that said there were delays or 'hang ups' while opening applications, but I didn't find that problem. We use Netflix and YouTube TV extensively, as well as Pluto TV and some of our 'unmentioned' streaming apps--not a single issue encountered after a week of heavy use. The ability to incorporate my Samsung TV, Samsung sound bar, and Fire Stick all in a single remote without having to 'learn' or punch in random codes is amazing. It also fits cleanly behind the TV, so there's one less electronic 'box' on top of the cabinet under the TV! Win-win!I will be purchasing more of these to replace the half-dozen TV boxes in our house, as these are too easy to use! The 5GHz wifi makes a HUGE difference over the current 2.4GHz TV box speeds. I have some that have failed wifi, so they have to be hard wired--no good!

"(Edited) Not ready for prime time - - Alexa on strike","UPDATE 1/16/2022I contacted Amazon customer service about replacing this unit. Before I completed the transaction I decided to try the voice control, which had not worked even with tech support sharing my screen. To my great surprise Alexa is now working. I can only guess that another update remedy the problem. The rest of my review stands as is.I bought the 4K Firestick with Alexa as a Christmas season deal direct from Amazon. As a streaming device this fire stick is acceptable.Pros: It was easy to set up, including integration with my VPN and connectivity to my wifi. Channel selection is very good and streaming is smooth and consistent despite my remote location.Cons:1. The interface, compared with my Roku 3, is a little awkward. Some of that may be due to my not being used to the particular design of the interface. But trying to look at all my installed apps or to even tell which ones are installed and which ones are available is a little clumsy.2. *** Poor history tracking: it does not allow me to return where I left off very well. For instance, I was watching Eureka on Amazon Prime, first season. The title pops up correctly in my recently watched row, but every time I click to play, the interface reverts to season 5 episode 1, and I have to drill down to Seasons... Episodes... figure out which episode I had left off at and select it.3. The screen timeout is abominably short. Every time I go to the bathroom or fix some tea, the screen goes to screensaver and I have to click through and say who's watching the fire stick and go to the channel I was watching and locate the episode. It's a little annoying.4. *** Alexa voice control from the Fire stick remote does not work. I get various error messages on the screen anytime I press the microphone button, all while the screen is telling me different suggestions for using Alexa. I have worked with tech support; they were very accommodating. They have shared my screen. We have updated my fire stick software. We have pressed all combination of different buttons at the same time and restarted the base; I've removed batteries from the remote, all to no avail. I have no voice control on my Alexa Firestick.The Firestick has a lot to recommend it, but this version is not ready for prime time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2022","D.

"Not great for home theater","It suffers from continuous audio dropouts when plugged into a receiver. I had to fuss with it for over an hour before I finally got it to a state where it wouldn't do it. What I found was that the dropouts occur when the sound is set to either ""Auto"" or ""Dolby Digital Plus,"" and setting it to ""Dolby Digital"" seems to have fixed the issue (setting it to stereo also worked, but... gross). From my searching on the internet, this seems to be a problem inherent to the device itself, and not something that can or will be fixed with a firmware update (thanks, Amazon!).I've had one plugged directly into a different TV for a while with no issue. I'm thinking that Amazon is just kind of playing the odds that most people won't be using a receiver, so fixing the issue isn't worth the time/money.

"Works very poorly in conjunction HUGHES Satellite internet","I am a recent subscriber to Hughes Net Satellite internet. So I was looking forward to using Amazons Firestick for weekend entertainment opportunities. The firestick installed and updated flawlessly. So I went to watch a movie, nothing but buffering and a message stating that there was no internet connection or that it was very slow. I did all the tests and it was showing that it works perfectly, until you try watching a movie or live TV and then it once again displays slow or not connected to the internet. I contacted Hughes Net. The service support tried a couple of tricks but to no avail. I then got onto Hughes public forum and started reading how many people were experiencing the exact same problem. It appears Hughes Net does not tell anyone that you can't stream TV or Movies over there system as I later found out from some unnamed satellite guru who calmly berated me on , ""how stupid I was for trying to use a firestick with Hughes Net, I should have known better"" Well now I'm locked into a 1 year deal and a firestick that I can't use.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2021","Kelton Shobe",129

"Who Needs Cable!","I dropped cable a long time back. Got tired of paying for program packages to get a particular channel while paying for channels I had no interest in. I received a Firestick for Christmas for my TV upstairs, but soon realized the Firestick would give me more than what my Smart TV downstairs would offer. It just seems the Firestick allows me to pick and choose, and guide my way to things I wanted to watch with much more ease. My Firestick allows me to select 2.4GHz and 5GHz. No problems with streaming. The only thing I haven't done is integrate ""Alexa"" or ""Dot"" to the Firestick, mainly because Alexa is kept in a different room where I would have to holler out what app I want to watch. I have done it and it will work just fine.My only complaint is that I would love to see a feature to bring up a browser (since I do like to browse sites with Keto recipes ((Pintrest and other such sites)).

"New Firestick keeps losing control of TV volume settings","I have tried at least 4 times and the new Firestick keeps losing the settings.I have a Samsung 82: QLED TV and a Panasonic Home Theater system w/Blu-Ray – SC-BTT490 that I have used for years. I recently bought the newest, available Firestick to control all devices and Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, etc.After struggling to get the Firestick to recognize the Panasonic Home Theater system, it finally recognizes it and turns it on and off with the TV. The Firestick volume control works too with the Home Theater speakers. Then in several days, the Firestick forgets the Panasonic Home Theater system and renders volume to just the TV.This has happened to me at least 4 times in the past several weeks.IT WORKS FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND THEN THE FIRESTICK FORGETS THE HOME THEATER SETTINGSI cannot find out how to correct this problem so the Firestick stays controlling the TV volume as played through the Panasonic Home Theater system of speakers.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2021","Jim",206

"Quality on the fire sticks has degraded","I bought this as a replacement to another fire stick that had started having issues with its remote. It wouldn't recognize the remote and the remote was burning through the batteries. This fire stick almost immediately started having the same issues. We replaced batteries and we ran through the recommended tech support. Any fixes only lasted a little while. Yesterday, the remote stopped working altogether. The fire stick was right about 30 days old from delivery date so I requested a replacement through Amazon support (a circuitous painful process). Amazon customer support refused unless I went through tech support again first. I could however get a refund (?) and so I did. I'm going back to Roku.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2021","Amazon Customer",219

"Dissapointed","I recently purchased this item with the expectation that with a trade-in of an old device I would receive a 20% discount which would be applied during checkout. That did not happen Amazon! I did not receive a 20% discount during checkout! I did receive a whopping $3 bucks for my old firestick + charger + USB cable + voice remote. I deregistered the old firestick then the morning of the next day I dropped off my old firestick at the location suggested thinking maybe, just maybe I'll receive the 20% discount once they have the old device. I received a confirmation email from Amazon saying my trade-in has been received and processed. But Nope! Still No 20% Discount! I then called so called customer support after acquiring the # via google. They were of no help. They actually suggested I purchase another one so I put one in my cart and started the purchase process and the 20% discount was applied to that one. Nowhere did I see where you had to turn in the trade-in device first then receive confirmation for it before purchasing the new firestick!

"Much Better than I expected","Hard to express given the questions provided.I don't use Alexa, so that answer is N/A, but N/A is not applicable because it's not a choice - funny but not funny who designs these ""survey"" type questions? If I had limitations I might use Alexa - but not so far.Yes the 4K Firestick does a good job turning on the TV and controlling the volume; however, my expectations were really low. Picture quality depends upon 1.) TV's quality and 2.) the signal's quality - I can't judge either. Everyone sells ""the best"" TV and ""the best"" signal. I can't even say if I have it installed on the best TV I own.I'm judging the 4K Firestick with my $$ - I just ordered 2 more of them. That's the best recommendtion I can give. Maybe its not the greatest Firestick but I see actual improvements.Honesty's the best policy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2021","Minnesota Mac",301

"Perfect Addition to TVs","This is my third Firestick.My first I bought to upgrade an existing TV (not a SmartTV) for my various streaming activities.I quickly bought 2 more for different TVs. I am considering getting another for my SmartTV as it's much faster with the various apps than the native ones.Pros: Upgrades a dumb TV to a SmartTV with very little effort. Additionally, with the Alexa integration, I can use voice commands to easily find content on my streaming services. Downloading new apps is easy and quick. Additionally, this voice control works with my Ring Cameras and I can quickly view various camera views using voice commands. I love this feature! Much quicker than using the Ring phone app. The remote is very intuitive and responsive, using BT in lieu of IR so it works without aiming it at the TV. I prefer the Firestick remote over my TV remotes as it is very well designed and works better.Cons: With a Vizio TV, the Firestick remote 'Power' does not work, instead pressing the 'Home' button for 5 seconds usually turns it on. But not consistently and may require using the Vizio remote to turn on. Otherwise all other functions work with the Firestick remote. Occasionally, with the Vizio TV, the Firestick will stop streaming and show a 'loading' icon. This requires a hard reboot (disconnect the Firestick and power supply to it) before it starts working again. Both of these issues seem to be only with my Vizio TV.One mixed pro/con. When purchasing an additional Firestick, it will come with your profile pre-loaded with your profile/ internet PW. This makes adding a new one much faster to your network. You will still need to download various streaming apps that you may have.Clearly though, this could create problems with security and/or if purchasing as a gift for someone else.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2022","HondaVFR750",302

"Causes interference on the HDMI Bus","I purchased this 4K Fire TV device along with an Ethernet adapter, since I have a network switch under my TV that has a direct connection to my router. This way I don't have the rely on wifi for HD reception. I hooked every up and it all seemed to be working fine on one of my spare HDMI ports on my Sony TV. As the days went by I started noticing that watching various movies from my Home screen, on Netflix, Prime Video, and Hulu, that I would get audio drop outs on my Sonos Beam Soundbar. When this would happen, I would back up the movie to see if the problem was with the movie, but it never was. It was getting so bad, that I also lost my surround speakers and they would come and go intermitently. I contacted Sonos, who has a very good support staff. After a couple of calls and sending them diagnostic codes, they told me that there was noise on the HDMI Bus and asked what other devices were plugged in. The only two devices were my Sony Blu-Ray player and the newly introduced Fire TV. Since I have the Blu-Ray player plugged in for over two years, I removed the Fire TV. Right away, I notice a difference. My surrounds came back and worked well, and as the evenings went by, I noticed that I stopped getting the audio drop outs. Actually, the Fire TV is only a platform to load and install apps that you have to pay for anyway. It's like my old Roku box which I removed a while back when Sony told me that I would need a CEC-less adapter for Roku. So, now it's less than one month and I don't know what to do. I placed everything back in their original boxes and may give Amazon a call tomorrow. Otherwise, I may just hold on to the two devices and see if anyone else wants them.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2022","John G",314

"Nice addition to our Vizio Smart TV 2017 model D32","We like this Firestick, and the operation of it. My only complaint is lack of instructions. Apparently it is assumed you have a newer TV, but nothing for setting this up on older smart tv's such as we have, which is a 2017 Vizion model D32 with HDMI port.Took me about half hour to finally figure out how to get the Firestick and our HDMI to find each other. I finally realized with our TV, you have to set your input...in this case input was HDMI...but for some reason it synced up with HDMI2 connection. I didn't understand it, but it is working well, after I figured out why I was seeing nothing about Firestick.In any case, after it did a software update, and finally booted up, worked well. Takes some time to find your way around and navigate, but this is a very clever nice addition to any Smart TV, especially older ones. I unplug the Firestick every night before we stop watching TV, you don't have too, but we do.A lot to watch that is included with Prime, as well as a lot through IMDBTv that has ads, but still a good selection of shows. The ads on IMDBTv are not too intrusive or long, it is just nice to be able to catch some shows we like and older shows.If you have a newer smart TV, I am sure it is easier to setup, but do not expect to be presented with many instructions, what you get is ok, but no addressing older TV's or any models in particular. You are on your own with that, but the instructions themselves are ok...just not any help for connecting to various TV's.Nice unit, worth the 29.99 we paid for it, and we love Prime too!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2021","Jim",333

"easy to install--just plug in to back of tv","My Vizio smart tv came with many apps to choose from. Some free, some to subscribe to. I needed the fire stick or something like it to be able to order an app that contain all the shows my husband likes to watch. This particular app had 60 different tv stations or movie apps you could watch with a fire stick. Plugged it in, handed the remote that came with it to my husband and told him to push the little blue button and tell it what he wanted to watch. He did, and bravo, there it was. Motor Trend, his favorite show. Both of us are tech challenged, he more so than I, but you don't really have to be tech smart to install this. Love it and love the remote and love Alexa. Should you have a place to plug in one of these on your tv, you need to order one. By the way. We are both Senior, Senior Citizens, like for a long time. A child could do this. By canceling our cable service which had gotten very expensive and purchasing the fire stick so we could use this app has saved us $100 a month.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2021","Maybell",396

"The remote becomes a TV and Fire stick control device.","This is my fourth Amazon stick purchase. The first two are for my two old TV and they work just fine for that era technology. The third stick is a 4K Fire Stick for one of the 4K Tv's that I have. I was happily impressed with the quality and sharpened of the screen, specially when I installed the Dish network App. The 4K stick allows me to see the dish programing in 4K where the dish reception is not. The only draw back is that not all the features are there and to arrive to an specific accomplishment requires a learning curve to get there. However once the learning process is done it's a pleasure to watch my favorite shows.My fourth Fire 4K stick connected to my last 4K TV created a small issue because the remote control buttons are not located in the same location as my previous stick. So now when I watch TV in the bedroom I have to have a small flashlite to iluminate the buttons otherwise I would be pressing a button that is not giving the result expected. That could be resolved if the buttons had a back light to softly iluminate the button without creating too much of an ilumination. Take note Amazon. The 4K stick is a great device and I completely recommend it to anyone that owns a 4K TV. With a decent internet connection this devise will provide endless amount of TV viewing enjoyment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2021","Jay Melo",397

"Security","We followed instructions and were directed to click link because it said are Amazon acct was locked due to security concerns. They emailed us saying they were Amazon and telling us someone would call and help fix it. This was a scam and we were hacked due to the poor security of your product. When we called Amazon we were told too bad and that was none of Amazon’s concern. Really disappointed in your reaction and not try to find out how they got into your product and trying to prevent this from happening to others who purchased an Amazon Firestick","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2021","Munchkin323",401

"Once it is up and running it is great","This model seems to have some setup issues, and based on my support searches, im not the only one who encountered this. Initial setup was a nightmare. Even with 500Mbps Internet, the out of box update would hang @ about 85%. I waited 3 hours for it to update before I decided to pull the plug. A restart got me to the same place. After 2 factory resets, the stick finally updated. Once that was done, it was smooth sailing. I'm a fairly technical person, so i cannot imagine what someone with only basic tech knowhow would react to this. I talked to 3 people who returned theirs as defective after encountering this problem. Amazon support was not very helpful They wanted me to change the HDMI port. I tried this on multiple TVs and monitors before and after the first factory reset and the result was the same unresponsive hang. Ive had the stick for about a month now and it is working perfectly. But that initial setup was enough to make me want to go back to my google tv","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2022","Jeffrey J Graczyk",410

"Does NOT show cameras like it says it does!","Took me forever to get ONE of the two of these I bought to even work. And then it would not show the camera feed for my Wyze cameras. My other Firestick I had before I bought 2 of these DID. So I know Wyze is compatible. But I just get a ""Sorry, this device does not support cameras""... the main reason I got these was to install on small TVs throughout the upper part of my house so I could use them as a sort of CCTV to keep a watchful eye on my elderly father downstairs. And it doesn't do what it says it is supposed to. And then Amazon wanted to charge me over $30 to return them!!! I am disabled and homebound. In the past, any time I have needed to return something to Amazon, they've sent UPS out to collect it. I've never had to pay any extortionate fees! The customer service rep was just awful, too. Very rude and unfeeling. We have bought SO MUCH from Amazon, especially these last few years BECAUSE (due to our health situation) we are shut-ins. I always felt confident buying from them because the few times we ever had a problem with merchandise, the returns process was accessible to us. Apparently not anymore. Therefore, we will be severely limiting what we buy from Amazon from now on. We are on a tight budget, so we can't shop in a place with the knowledge that they don't stand behind their products if there is an issue, and they make you pay so much to return it, it's untenable.Buyer, be VERY aware!!!","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2022","Jan",415

"It's OK","As a long-time cord cutter, here is my review. I'm comparing to my older Roku(s) here. Going to state up front that I'm in a rural area and my Internet occasionally gets sketchy.Pros: It offers better bandwidth management options, especially for Prime video. This is the main reason I attempted to ditch my Roku(s). (Unless you have a nice router, a Roku will just stream at the best quality it can, regardless of how much bandwidth it is sucking up, especially for Amazon Prime).It's fairly snappy, running circles around my Roku.The Fire TV will pause if you set a sleep timer on your TV. This is great because the Roku would keep right on playing if your TV turned off.All, in all, for the money it is a solid device.Cons: During the occasional storm and other events, my Internet has gone out for a few days or so. When the Internet goes out for the Fire TV, it is pretty close to being relegated to a fishing weight.This isn't totally the Fire TV's fault, but the Plex TV app on Fire can't connect directly to a Plex Server. And even if it did, if there is no Internet, you can't get to a single %#%$#^% app on the Fire TV.I did discover that you can screen cast to it with no Internet, but you know what doesn't work with screen casting to a Fire TV? Amazon Prime (and I'm casting from my phone, which a lot of time still has Internet).The Plex app on Roku will let you use your Plex server even if the Internet is out (for the most part).I have a pretty good investment in my Plex server and have had to keep all of my Rokus on because they work much better with Plex.I was really hoping for a Roku killer and I would be done with the bandwidth sucking devices. Unfortunately, the Fire TV did not allow me to do that, so here I am with two different boxes now.Actually, because I just moved to a cell plan with unlimited Internet, I also have a Chromecast because streaming through my phone works better than my home Internet at the present.To date, I haven't found any Chromecast app on the Fire TV that I like, and even if there was one, it wouldn't work if the Internet goes out...because you can't get to a single app on the Fire TV without an active Internet connection. Like I said, the Internet goes out, it becomes a fishing weight.So here I am with three devices, and the Fire TV gets three stars because of that.------------Update: I did find after searching the Net that there is a way to launch apps on the device if your Internet is out. It's not obvious at all, but it isn't too difficult. On the Roku, you can get to all your apps normally, but they will warn you if there is no Internet. On the Fire TV, you have to dig through a bunch of menus in the settings.So, I came up with a setup I'm happy with. Turned on DLNA on Plex and installed VLC app on FireTv. I haven't fully tested this, but it should work to stream movies to my TV in the event of an Internet outage.Also installed VLC android app on my phone. From the Fire Tv or my phone, VLC was up and streaming movies with just a few button clicks. Now that's the way things are supposed to work. Good job VLC team.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2022","Jay",416

"Not a single complaint","We love this device. Even though we have a smart TV (we bought this for a different TV), we've been using this as the streaming device due to its complete ease of use and full integration with Alexa and our home security setup. Being able to stream all our favorite services, content from our phones (smart view) and home ""cloud drive"" (apps may be required, we use Plex) could not be easier. The video and audio quality has been great as well and it responds so quickly, its a dream to use (no, this is not sponsored, LOL). I can walk in the room, tell Alexa to turn on the tv and launch a show/movie/service, ask her to view the front door ring cam, etc... AND, I can pair Bluetooth devices, like headphones, with it so I can listen without disturbing someone who may be sleeping nearby. Cannot be happier with this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2022","JJ Dempsey",439

"ZERO buffering since upgrading to the 4K stick","I owned the regular fire stick for years and would constantly encounter buffering/crashing/freezing issues (most notably while using Hulu). It would constantly lose connectivity despite the TV being less than 6 feet away from my router and none of my other devices using Wi-Fi were being affected or otherwise losing their signals. It would also get VERY hot after just an hour or two. Same issues would occur on a different fire stick at my parents’ house with a similar proximity to the router. No amount of problem solving, cache/data clearing, or uninstalling & reinstalling was helping, so I figured I’d order the 4K stick when it was on sale to see if a next-gen device would still have the same problems even though I don’t have a 4K tv (but I do like the Amazon interface and Home Screen layout). After two months of usage, I haven’t had a single instance of buffering on any app and not once has it lost connectivity (although it still says my signal strength is just “good” even though the router is literally right beside it). Will update if this changes, but so far, so good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2022","Jimmy",446

"can not control bluetooth device with fire stick remote","This is my 2nd fire stick. I've been impressed with my 2nd gen fire stick but dropping it multiple times has taken its tole (buy a cover). A feature I've enjoyed is controlling the volume and mute, on my blue tooth head sets, via the fire stick remote, but i was sorely disappointed to find the my new ""Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device with latest Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), Dolby Vision"" does not have this feature. Reading multiple reviews I've noticed many complaints it doesn't control blue tooth speaker either. So my assumption is that it does not control blue tooth devices at all. My older stick has software ver 7.2.7.3 and newer ver fire OS 6.2.8.7 . MAYBE AMAZON COULD DO A SOFTWARE UPDATE!!","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2022","Annie",453

"Exceeds Expectations!!!!","I have recommended the Amazon Firestick to friends and family! We have 4 Amazon Firesticks installed ( one per TV) and an Amazon Recast for local over the air broadcast signals. The Amazon devices have exceeded our expectations! They were easy to install and set up. Any action needed during set up, the Firestick guides you thru. Within minutes, you can stream your favorite programs. WHO NEEDS CABLE TV or the bill from cable TV? Why pay for channels you don’t watch? All you need is a DSL or an ISP internet connection to stream programs thru your Amazon Firestick! When we switched to the Amazon Firestick and Recast, we had every local channel and movie service anyone could ask for. The picture quality is superb, sharp and clear! You can easily search for programs ( just ask Alexa- she will find it). And, there are many extras because you can interface the Alexa function to turn lights on or off, check the front door camera and so on). The Amazon Firestick is versatile, stable and provides a service that is second to none ( it is a number 1 platform for your TV service and household). It is well worth the price. Thank you Amazon for a great product and service!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2022","Memphis",454

My phone can turn into a remote but it doesn't always work right as Iv tried also I have a four year old who wants to things fast. The family member who gave this to me e assured me e it wasn't pricey so I decided to give itvago. It is as pretty easy to use remote which no is good be cc abuse my daughter can use it and there's as couple of extra apps it supports. Thats the pro, the con, it's small and can get lost easily.

"Enjoying using it But,…","I’m enjoying using it but, all thing’s considered spend the extra $15 or $20 more and buy the Max which has the newer firmware. I’m a geek at heart and in some sick twisted way, I had fun watching a bunch of YouTube videos, setting up a ftp on my laptop, backing up all the apps to it and then formatting the external usb stick transferring all the apps back onto the usb and reloading them as external on the firestick. Went from a gig free to 3.24 free. But it took me half a day. The two things I learned are that some apps don’t behave properly when moved to external memory and when it’s time to update an app that wasn’t written to be on external memory, it won’t update. You have to reinstall it and then uninstall it and move it to the usb again. The new firmware makes this a one click easy transition. And I have the feeling that the older stick will never get the full upgrade to the newer firmware either because of some technical reason OR more likely because - They want to sell you the newer stick.Update - Other reviews complaining about ads and WiFi connection problems, turn off the ads and fix your bad WiFi. The stick can’t do it for you. And Yes the ONN Walmart device is $20 but it’s missing some features.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2021","Hub",463

"So slow if it were faster I’d be so happy","I was so excited for my fire stick to arrive and got to setting it up immediately! Fling story short that took TWO DAYS because it kept saying the internet quality was too poor but we have an extender specially for this purpose. It finally let me set it up but now only Netflix works and HBO go only sometimes but take forever to load. None of the live channels work which is half the reason we got the fire stick. I’m going to contact support to see if they can help us but right now I feel defeated frustrated and feel that this was not a good purchase. We previously had Roku and thought it’d be an upgrade but right now it feels like a downgrade.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2022","Amazon Customer",465

"For those having Remote pairing issues...Overall good product","Like many reviews here... I had significant issues with getting the remote to pair. It seems to be an issue with the software version on the device being mis-matched with the software on the remote with the Alexa button.I was able to work around this by pairing an existing remote I had for the Firestick with the simple Voice button on top(that also had volume control) - that remote worked almost instantly after pressing the home button for 10 seconds and I was able to complete the setup. I was still unable to add the new remote no matter what I did (would not show up as discoverable)I then had to do a software update on the Fire stick; which then made the NEW remote discoverable but it ALSO required an update before it would finish the setup. Once both the firestick and the new remote were updated, it all finally worked as expected.I'm unaware of a solution if you do not have an older remote to do the initial setup of the fire stick.Otherwise the performance of the device is great. No complaints on features/functionality.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2022","Chad B.",469

"Helpful to organize and watch all streaming services","Recently I decided to stop cable TV and limit watching tv to the streaming services I subscribed to. Prior to purchasing this device it was a lot more cumbersome (not difficult) to open and use these services. Now, after signing in once to the services all I have to do is use the built in Alexa to ask it to watch a particular program or type of program (ie: action movies or “Blue Bloods”) and it will open that program. There are also connections to free streaming services included for use with the product. I have not missed my cable TV subscription at all.One thing of note though, you do need to have decent high speed internet to get the best from the product. And I already had both the high speed internet and the subscriptions to the streaming channels, this device has just made it so much simpler to use them.Connection is easy….simple plug in connection and you also need wireless streaming internet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2021","Sashmol",471

"Good stick","I like the firestick since it is easy to use, it literally walks you through setup and in about 15-20 minutes you are up and going. The picture quality is great and the streaming is good as long as you have a good network.One drawback I do not like is the layout. The advertising on home page can be annoying. It does keep what you are in the middle of watching in one of the top rows. I do not like the push for prime shows, it could be layed out better with filters for free shows vs prime, paramount, tubi, free, and so on.On the newer models you have buttons on the bottom for netflix, disney and whatever. I don't use them so I consider them a waste of remote space.I would like to see the remote upgraded to glow buttons, I have seen these on other remotes, if you move the remote the buttons will have a soft light to them so you can see what you are pressing.Walk tall and carry a big stick!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2022","stingerdoc",472

"Lowers the IQ of your TV.","I honestly think this is the worst of all the streaming devices. It’s always breaking. You always have to restart/refresh/unplug, etc. all the time. I’ve gone through several, but it’s my fault because I keep buying it (Mainly because it’s cheaper than most other devices). I ordered the protection plan for the last purchase & have already had to order a replacement. Get this, the one that they replaced it with is also defective. The annoying part is that if it’s not one thing it’s the other. Now the remote is also broken & It’s not the battery.I have a few smart TVs, but I still like to buy streaming devices for many reasons. I have appleTV on the main TV, Roku on another TV, one bedroom has an old AppleTV, Roku in another bedroom, & FireStick in my bedroom. I figured I’d save $$ by getting the FireStick. Well… bad idea. Either every one that I get is defective or they’re all just junky. BTW - my bedroom TV is also the only TV that isn’t a smart TV. The FireStick doesn’t add to its IQ, either. Oh well, I guess I’ll buy another ROKU.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2022","Vanessa",473

"Pleasantly surprised","Was nervous as to what to expect switching to streaming instead of cable. Realized my tv was not a smart tv the fire stick is so simple to use. Literally just plug in into the tv and wall outlet and start watching tv. Only thing I did not realize when ordering is that the fire stick has to be plugged into a wall outlet as well as the tv no big deal but just know it will not work without it. Super user friendly my husband isn’t great with technology but he’s figured it out so I have faith anyone can. My only suggestion would be to by a bright remote control case/cover because these fire stick remotes are tiny and black and VERY easy to lose. All in all definitely worth the money - the apps you can get are limitless and the streaming is so easy. Picture quality/ streaming quality is great I cannot tell any difference in it and the DIRECTV we used to have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2022","Prime Time",475

"Avoid","My fire tv stick got stuck on the logo screen after automatic update routine.Amazon customer support said they are aware of the problem and trying to fix it on their end. They said it may take a while and asked me to be patient (meaning having no streaming for indefinite time…).It has been days without a solution and when I asked them to replace it they told me it is out of the 1 year warranty. I told them it is not a warranty issue because they actually bricked the device with a bad update. They don’t deny that fact but still will not replace with a new unit and I now have a brick with no support.Amazon do not stand behind their own products the way they used to and I’m only getting an overseas support with bad english and robotic behavior.I am canceling my years long prime membership and getting my content elsewhere.Shame on you Amazon.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2022","Gil Yaron",476

"My Second Firestick","My first Firestick stopped working (after the remote did, and I was never able to revive the remote and resorted to the excellent smart phone app remote). It is connected via a dongle to my small monitor that I keep in the kitchen and transport to my sewing room.After purchasing this as a replacement, it occurred to me that the problem may have been with the dongle, and sure enough that was the case. I now have 2 firesticks, but I'm happy with that. I can keep one connected to my large TV, and enjoy using one with my traveling monitor.Although my cable company has the apps on the TV, the picture quality through the firestick is superb v. the one coming through the cable. I'm sure there is reason for it, which is above my pay grade--so I'm glad to enjoy this convenience for a modest cost relative to my use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2022","Leisa",476

"Remote Stopped working","I installed my fire stick on to my TV in Feb 2022. It's not even 3 full months & the remote just stopped working. I tried changing the battery but that did not work. Several attempts to pair the remote also did not work. This is the second time i face this issue as my previous Amazon stick stopped working & had issues with remote. This is disappointing & frustrating when a new item stops working. Purchasing or replacing the remote is not easy as well as it will cost me same money that i spent to buy the whole things. What a shame that Amazon can not ensure quality control of their own products....","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2022","S.M",476

"Time to dump cable or satelite TV? This IS THE solution we should have used several years ago!","Note that we are not currently using the Alexa integration.Going from satelite or cable TV is a daunting prospect: will I find local channels and my cable/satelite favs? Yes, you will, and this makes it pretty easy to make the transition.Oh, and really cost effective. The one-time cost for the purchase of 5 Fire Sticks is less than our monthly satelite service. And we get more interesting content.We have transitioned all 5 of our home based TV's.Yes, there is a bit of a learning curve and installation takes about 20-30 minutes per set. In our case, we lost 2 non-local PBS stations, but all thing considered: so worth making the change.And if you have an RV, this is a must. No more satelite dish to haul and install, no more lousy cable service, or lack of over-the-air service in remote areas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2022","janine",477

"Made in China","Flaw #1 you can only connect one set of headphones or one audio source via bluetooth. However, you can connect your bluetooth headset and bluetooth keyboard simultaneously. A keyboard will come in handy if you have to type in searches or passwords or profile stuff. Oh, and guess what? You won't find anything in the directions about anything related to bluetooth or even on the box. But if you fiddle with the onscreen setting you will run across it.Flaw#2: The directions suckIf your remote doesn't pair with your TV correctly at first just remove your TV and redo the pairing.You can download and install APPS so you can watch movies and TV and you can uninstall them as well. So, if you're not familiar with this, you can download HBO max or Showtime Max and sign up for a monthly subscription without having a cable TV service. There are many free TV apps etc but you will have to deal with ads. ROKU has free TV and movies but you will have to watch a few ads maybe twice during a 45 minute episode of your fav TV show. If you have Amazon prime you may be ad free. I don't know. I don't want to pay for anything or watch ads but I'm dealing with it for now.Flaw#3: The firestick remembers I have headphones paired but when I turn on the device I have to physically go into settings and connect them but sometimes I don't and it will connect them automatically when I turn the headphones on. If I forget to connect my headphones at startup and I go into an APP and start watching a show. I have to go back to the home screen and go into setting and connect my headphones. Then I have to go find the app I was using and go back to my show. The stick doesn't have a recently viewed section that actually works. The problem is there are so many apps that I sometimes forget which app I went into to watch that show. You can however ask Alexa to just play the episode of whatever you were watching if you can remember what you were watching. I feel like this function of continuing watching the show you were watching could be better. You know how everybody likes to binge watch but at some point you have to turn off the TV, right? When you go back the next day there should be a section box that you can click on that shows you what show you were on last and allow you to go right to it. There is a recently viewed section that doesn't really show you what you recently viewed. I call that useless.you have to have good data speeds otherwise you'll never see 4k. I have hotspot on my phone but the data speeds in my area suck most of the time. But I'm paying too much for cell service to buy home internet that isn't much better.Just so you know, this firestick will stay connected to your wifi even when powered off and it will automatically connect when disconnected no matter what. So, when I turn on my phone hotspot the firestick will jump right on and so will my Vizio TV and so will my Laptop. I have to go in my phone and limit my devices so be forwarned.and that's all I know for now","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2022","George",477
"Great streaming device.","This is my fourth fire stick. These devices are inexpensive but high quality. The later generations have consistently gotten faster. The user interface is good. The voice recognition works very well. One of the best features is that the remote can learn the commands for turning your tv on and off and for adjusting the volume. This very simple remote can replace your tv remote for most viewing applications. The remote can also learn the volume commands for a sound bar, but I still need the sound bar remote to turn that off. The preprogrammed streaming service buttons are very convenient and work well. I do watch prime video, but also Hulu, Netflix and other services. This streaming device is equally effective for all of these services bi continue to be very happy with this device.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2022","Martin",477
"New 4K Fire stick is a huge improvement over the original.","I purchased my original Fire stick from Amazon around 2018 for my then eight year old Samsung HD tv. It worked well but would often freeze up on me, requiring a re-boot. I purchased the 4K Fire stick and it arrived a couple of days before super bowl Sunday. I noticed a huge improvement immediately. It loads content faster and it brought back the super sharp picture on my now 12 year old 55” Samsung HD tv. The new remote has easy to use controls, including Alexa. The best new feature is the ability to sync the Fire remote with my 10 year old Yamaha sound bar, which allows me to control the volume directly from the Fire tv remote. Another great feature is the Bluetooth connectivity. I can now pair my Bluetooth headphones with the Fire stick and watch tv at night without disturbing my wife. Amazon did a great job on the upgrade. Buy yours today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2022","Mico C",477

"Atmos is tricky","To get Dolby Atmos the Firestick has to be plugged directly into my Samsung HW Q700A sound bar, and not into my TV set and then the TV to the soundbar. With this arrangement of hardware, then the approach to get Atmos varies with the service. So for HBOmax, if it is going to work for a selected item, Dolby Atmos is automatic. With Apple TV+ it is not going to work at all. And for Prime Video, you have to start watching, select the Options icon, scroll to Audio, and then click on Dolby Atmos (in the rare event it is available). (By the way, Apple TV reciprocates: it won’t supply Atmos for Prime Video items, just like Firestick won’t do it for Apple items.)I’d add to this that with my sound bar, Atmos makes very little difference. I know it is present because the sound bar displays Dolby Atmos when it is delivered. Maybe if I added the optional rear speakers??","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2021","Advisor",477
"Great picture but seems buggy","I have several Fire devices and following the failure of a remote for my FireTV, I decided to upgrade my first stick to a 4K device rather than simply buying a replacement remote. There is a noticeable improvement in picture quality and the user interfaces have been upgraded.However, despite only owning the device for a few months, it's already frozen several times, requiring me to unplug the unit to reset it. Further, it no longer goes to sleep by holding the home button. If this is happening within the first few months then I am afraid how this device will perform in the next year or two.Also, the remote also doesn't feel as sturdy as prior remotes and the battery cover doesn't lock as securely into place. I am hopeful that it will last.It is convenient for streaming but given this device has existed through several generations I would have expected better performance and fewer quirks this early in ownership.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2022","Michael R.

"Good consolidation of remotes","As a long time apple tv 2 user I really liked its small remote. When more and more streaming apps started to be discontinued on the apple tv we moved to using the PS4 as our streaming device. The cumbersome remote/controller of that brought us to getting an FireTV stick which costs as much as a PS4 TV remote and I must say I wish I had done that years earlier. It has a small remote, supports all channels and most important, can manage volume and other features of your TV or receiver as well. Now we just have 1 compact remote to manage everything. Both audio and video look are great even though I still have an old 1080 HD tv.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2021","Amazon Customer",477
"Works great...when it works","Out of the gate we love fire sticks. Have them on every TV. The consolidated streaming options just work really well for our families needs. BUT it doesn't take long before they are glitchy and/or unresponsive. We inevitably find ourselves having to frequently unplug and reset them, as the stick will randomly and frequently become unresponsive to the remotes. The child's account on the app, while great in theory, is particularly confusing for them when tv shows appear on their home screen that they can't actually watch because it's tied to a service we don't subscribe to. The fire stick and related app setup needs a TON of work, but thankfully aren't that expensive compared to cable networks and such so for now we continue to buy them and deal with the annoyances.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2022","Ashley Coleman",477
"Works for me!","We recently decided to get rid of our satellite cable after 20 years as we could not justify the monthly bill. Between the two of us, my husband and I watch less than 10 hours of TV a week. We decided to purchase an antenna for local channels and I bought this Firestick 4K streaming device for our bedroom (not smart) TV. A nice bonus was Amazon linked it to my account for easier set-up.Install took minutes with clear instructions and no glitches, or hiccups. The Alexa integration was pretty straightforward and I am getting better using this application. There are tons of content, free and paid to choose from. I am not a fan of the huge ad banner promoting shows but what can you do? The picture and sound are both excellent, it boots up quick, streams seamlessly and meets all my needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2022","Tr@cie",478
"Amazing Performance -- Low Cost","This is my first external streaming device, my only other experience being the ROKU built into my TCL TV. I've got to say that this is easier and the quality seems to be every bit as good. Because I had wired Ethernet in the bedroom left over from a previous AT&T UVerse box I used the Amazon wired adapter which took away any worries about wireless coverage. Setup was dead simple and I had it working within minutes with several different streaming sources -- Prime and YouTube being the first. The most time-consuming part was training the remote to work with the Panasonic TV and that only took a couple of minutes of button pressing following the instructions. I don't really use the voice recognition, not being used to it, but the few times I tried it seemed to work fine -- I'm just a button masher at heart.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2022","J.

"Beware!","This was a terrible experience. I ordered the Firestick and couldn't get it to pair with Alexa. I troubleshooted with an Amazon tech and she hung up on me when we couldn't fix the problem. This happened TWICE.On the third try the agent said I had the wrong device and would mail me another.The same problem occurred with the second one. Another agent worked with me for about 45 minutes and couldn't solve the problem. She said she was going to investigate and also email me a return authorization. I never heard back from her and she didn't send the return authorization.I called the Best Buy Geek Squad. Ended up having to have someone to come to the house since a phone agent couldn't fix it either. As it turns out, after he worked with both sets, he said both were defective.Thank goodness I subscribe to total tech support.Very frustrating!","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2022","Mary Ann Evans",478
"All Your Streaming Services in One Place","I recently got rid of my satellite tv service which I had for 25 years. I started streaming live tv in one of the streaming services which is going to save me hundreds of dollars per year. I had google chrome cast and we were having a hard time adjusting to casting using a phone or tablet, because we were used to using a remote control. I decided to order the Amazon Fire Stick and was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to put all my streaming services in one place including live tv. The remote is great and allows us to quickly shift between streaming services including live tv, especially with the Amazon Prime, Netflix, Disney+, and Hulu buttons included.

The tactile feeling on the remote is perfect, voice commands work well, and the LiveTV button blends seamlessly where I get a feeling that I'm actually a cable subscriber. I love this thing so much, that I doubt I'll ever get a SmartTV, Amazon has come so far with this where SmartTV's UI and experience feel cheap in comparison (Yeah, I know actual TVs exist loaded with this, but I'd likely update the Firestick before I felt I needed a screen update, I feel it's best to keep these things separate/modular).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2021","Kris Spade",478
"Drops connection all the time","The stick drops connections quite a bit. It will tell me home is not available when it drops its connection. I was skeptical of this. When the stick states it does not have a connection, my laptop and phone never lose a connection and work fine.Example from tonight. Started to watch espn+, it dropped the connection. I restarted the stick and it started to work again. At the same time, my laptop never lost a connection. Then it dropped the connection again and exited the espn app. I restarted it and it would not connect or launch the espn app so I just switched to my laptop and watched the game from the browser. My browser has not lost connection yet.I will return to using my laptop to stream.

"Doesn't do what I got it for.","The main reason I got this is to work with the Fire TV Recast, which records over the air broadcasts. The user on the phone app doesn't work with Recast, but this isn't a review of Recast. Fire TV is needed to play the recordings on Recast, but getting to the recordings is nearly impossible. The recordings don't show up on Fire TV, except sometimes randomly. The voice recognition really sucks, I say ""DVR Recordings"", and 9 times out of 10 it doesn't recognize it as what I said. So I ask ""What did I just say?"" and it shows ""d. v. r. recordings"" which is right, but it doesn't actually show DVR recordings. I'm ready to bag the Fire TV and Recast business because they work so poorly. Roku is way better, but doesn't have an Antenna TV DVR option.

"Good overall, TERRIBLE for viewing IMDB TV","UPDATE: Overall this is an excellent product with a simple clean remote that is laid out well. Amazon Prime and Netflix apps are great. But viewing IMDB TV programs using the IMDB app is a challenge since the latest update (was better before update). After pausing a program, when you press play, the bottom 1/3rd of the screen is covered by the timeline and large icons for other episodes of the same program you're watching (if it's a TV series). Above that, the middle 1/3rd of the screen is covered by text description and title of currently playing program. THIS GOES ON FOR 12 SECONDS, RUINING THE PLAYBACK OF THE PROGRAM. This is an app issue, and since Amazon owns IMDB they are ultimately responsible for the app. So one star off for that.

There are an incredible amount of free streaming services with a lot of current content. If you want local content then subscribe to a streaming service that will offer your local stations for more than half the price you pay the big cable and sat companies.

There are more free movies and YOutubes and stuff than I could watch in a lifetime. I think we bought a $5 sub to KERA the public channel here - wife likes that.

"Good device, but the remote could be more intuitive","I have had four of these Fire Sticks prior to this one. Each gets incrementally better. I am not a fan of the remote control layout. For one thing, it is not lighted, so it requires a fair amount of light to see the buttons, which are not especially logical. The ring control is a poor design and having the options in one of nine unmarked buttons is irritating. The listing of other streaming services (besides Prime Video) suggests a payoff. Really, Disney+? Why not Apple+? The home page is a mini-mental status test. It could be better. I actually got yet another Fire Stick because neither Xfinity nor my Sony smart TV has the Apple TV+ app, so I am forced to go through yet another device that I, personally, don't need for other streaming.

"questionable data efficiency?","I have many streaming devices, from original Chromecasts, to 4k FireSticks/TV, Roku, PS/Xbox, 4k blu-ray players...etc. I wanted to try this stick to see if the quality was better than my Xbox One X for overall streaming. (as Amazon Music HD is limited on the Xbox app, and I'm running a very high resolution 7.4.4 system) The picture looks good, possibly better than the Xbox1X feed, but the overall audio seems more compressed, and Amazon Music HD seems to not assess the device capability correctly (always 16bit, rather than 24 bit). So without add'l info gathering, I'm going to assume this stick isn't passing audio content in the most efficient manner, or is slightly limiting the throughput - granted, it is a wifi-connection over the ethernet connection (Xbox1X), but it is sitting next to the router, and I have consistent, ~900+mbps wifi throughput.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2021","CC",479

"Wasted hours & hours trying to make the remote work.","Alexa worked, e.g., to “show weather” or “show comedies”, but not to “rewind 1 minute”. Buttons to the left and right of the play/pause button, and the pause/play button itself, did not work. I returned this FireTV for cause, and ordered a replacement FireTV.I had my son (a networking technology & intrusion detection guru) come over to see if he could help with the 2nd FireTV. He set it up, and as I recall it seemed to work ok: the buttons (see above) worked initially, but then they quit working. Alexa worked, e.g., to “show weather” or “show comedies”, but not to “rewind 1 minute”. Disappointed a 2nd time, I’m not sure what to do next.It is noted that the foldout leaflet was printed in a font so small I had to use a magnifying glass to read it -- not good.But now, even though all of the above problems still persist, there is a new development. When I bring the Sling app into play, all of the problems clear up. The rewind and fast forward buttons now work, as does the pause/play button. BUT, only while the Sling app is running.The literature that came with FireTV gave me no inkling that running the Sling app would (just temporarily) clear up anything. Maybe running other apps (e.g., hulu) would do the same. It would be easy to just let the remote function properly from the outset, wouldn't it? Not disclosing that the remote would not work is just wrong of Amazon. Not disclosing that running the Sling app would temporarily make the remote work properly is also wrong of Amazon.I could remark that Amazon deliberately disabled the remote to force users to sit through all of the ads in a misguided attempt to generate ad revenue for their own advantage, instead of simply enabling the full function of the remote as advertised in their own literature.Will update this review as experience warrants.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2022","jlr",479

They connected with me QVC and Amazon hung up instead of staying on so I could prove it wasn't QVC. So Now I have to use 2 boxes for my TV. One from Comcast Plex for QVC, and Firestick for something else because Amazon as usual isn't very helpful, and they love to blame other companies for their shortcomings.

"Excellent Streaming Device","What am I streaming? Netflix, Hulu, Prime, HBO Max, Apple TV+, Disney+Why did I need it? I was on vacation with family in a rented condo. The tv was not a smart tv. So, I ran to the nearest Best Buy and bought the device. It is my 5th. I know how well the Fire Sticks work and how easy they are to set up.My Experience. I had it connected and streaming Prime Video in less than 5 minutes. It took more time to look up the passwords to the other streaming service than it did to get them streaming. Fast and easy. All you need is good or better wi fi. When the vacation was done, I disconnected everything and took it home until our next vacation. Had I thought ahead, I would have brought a Fire Stick with me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2021","Professor Diabolicus",480
"Way better than paying for cable !!","This is totally worth buying. Before our cable used to be 200+ for internet and TV. We switched to only this and roku Tvs not long after they became big. Now the total is only 150 for everything at the most.... internet, plus the subscriptions we have to Netflix, Hulu, Disney, prime, and a few others. They have everything we need plus more. The remote is also great for kids because of the voice option. My 6 year old is learning to spell and read. When she can't spell titles of what she wants to watch, she uses the voice option.. makes life so much easier for us both ! Thats the one thing I love way more about the firestick than roku.

"Uses up TOO much internet data!!","The picture clarity and everything else is top notch. My issue, is that even when I’m not using it, it’s eating up all of my monthly allotted internet data.I’ve been receiving alerts from Comcast/Xfinity telling me that I’ve used up 90%, etc., of my data since I’ve been using the Fire stick. This has been happening after only a few days into each month. I’ll have to pay more on my cable bill if I go over my limit.It keeps using up your data even when you aren’t using the fire stick as long as it’s hooked up to the tv. I’ve started unplugging it from the tv now. Just watching one movie uses a lot of data.

"Very Happy","I already own (2) second generation fire TV sticks, I use these on my (2) 1080 HD TV's. I bought this first 3rd generation FIRE TV stick for (1) of my (3) 4K TV's it was so easy to set up and liked it so well, for the quality and advanced 3rd generation features. I just ordered 2 more for my other 4K TV's. All of my TV's are smart TV's and have streaming too, but these fire sticks really pull in the Wi Fi signal much stronger!! Give your smart TV a break, these fire sticks really pull in signal much better! They optimize for HD and Dolby Vision and Atmos if you have that.

"Works like a charm","I think it was pretty straightforward to set up, although I must confess to not having done the set-up myself, thanks to my tech-savvy daughters. The second one we installed on a small kitchen TV did not function initially. My daughter had installed it with the short extension cable, so I unplugged it, removed the extension and plugged it back in and, what do you know, it worked just fine! It's easy to use, and the voice recognition is pretty good, but not perfect; it's certainly helpful most of the time in getting to a different app or programme. The Prime, Netflix, Hulu and Disney specific buttons are also a handy addition. All in all, we are very happy with it's functionality and value for money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2022","Amazon Customer",480

Unfortunately, as you wander into deeper real of enjoyment you'll be prompted of low storage and deleting other apps. Sadly it will be a brickwall for the more advanced users. I installed Real Racing 3 and it was functional, looks good but only able to finish the training/tutorial race. No more space left to download 1GB of game date to play the real game. There's plenty of juice in this stick to render the game fairly playable. Asphalt 8 racing game runs fine and smooth which is impressive. I hope there's a way to increase storage space.

"If you have 4K TV, you need this upgrade","This was an upgrade from a 1st gen Fire TV (HDTV) purchased in 2015. We bought a 4K TV a few years back, but I did not upgrade the Fire TV as there was little 4K content available at that time. Well time slipped by and it seemed like the old Fire TV was not doing the job, flesh tones were bad and it seemed to lacking clarity. Well, the new 4K Fire TV Stick fixed all that. (Kicking myself for waiting so long.) The new 3rd gen remote was also worth the upgrade as well. I was using a separate IR remote to manage the sound bar and now the Fire TV manages everything very well. One button on/off, sound up/down/mute and great voice integration.

In that case, I simply shut off the TV, then I get what I’m looking for.I like the fact that I can watch just about everything I want to watch, when I want to watch it.

Fast-forward a few years and this thing is amazing, i love it. i have been a loyal roku fan (not the sticks) and got this firestick with an extreme distaste for amazon electronics. I got it for my child because it is youtubekids compatible unlike the roku and they wouldn't mind the freezy laggyness like i would. What i got instead was a no lag, no issue, streaming amazing quality, and user friendly to an adult and a child whos just learning this stuf.

"Beats the heck out of our Comcast DVR!","We have a Comcast DVR that also has most of the apps we use available through it. But the performance of the box is so dismally slow that I hate using it! Plus, on the Disney+ app, the remote moves the cursor multiple choices for each press of the selector, making it nearly impossible to select a show. The fire TV eliminates all those issues. All the apps work as expected and the response is immediate. It’s not perfect- it won’t let you default to a stereo output, but will only output sound in the format it’s recorded and it MUST be plugged into the hdmi extension or it won’t work.

I was using three remotes before and this consolidated me down to one, which is always nice. I can still get all the Apple TV shows as this also has an Apple TV app which is fantastic.

First choice should be to skip this, second step should also have skip this etc...Too simple for the UI team that owns this project to stand up to the upper level.Fire TV UI to move/remove apps is horrible. Why not have the move option persist until the user is done moving apps. Why display the options to move and then give the all powerful “Are you sure” prompt after selecting it. Need to be able to remove proprietary apps that are not used nor will they ever be used. Hiding is at least something but if they are never going to be used seems like inefficient and ineffective design.Next is the remote.

"Low Quality Remote, Everything else Works as Advertised","This product worked pretty much as advertised. The sole issue i had was poor manufacturing quality for the remote control. The primary, center button doesn't seem to fit into the remote very well, like it catches on the arrow buttons next to it. So, when you push the button down, the button also randomly depresses an arrow key, making your on-screen selection go haywire. For instance, you hit the main button to select a show, but instead, the remote sends the ""go up"" command than then ""select the show"", so you get the wrong show. This happens two out of three button pushes. Low quality control from manufacturing.I put in a request with Amazon, their automated system said it would send a replacement, but now I can't find a record of that and my return window has closed.Hopefully this is a one-off manufacturing issue and not present on a large number of remotes.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2022","Andrew P.

I even got her (and myself!) some covers for the remote to not only protect them and for better grips, but mostly for the colors since I would constantly lose that small black remote in my blankets lol.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2022","Theresa",484
"Very poor Wifi Hardware in this device","I purchased 4k version to upgrade from the first generation Fire Stick, because the new interface was causing a lot of lag. I figured a new stick with a better processor would be better.I got the 4k device connected it to my TV and connected to my router. At best I could get a good connection. I pulled it off and reconnected my old first generation Fire Stick and I got a very good connection. Also, I have a Roku 4 connected to the TV that connects with an excellent connection. I plugged the 4k back in and started to try and watch some shows on Prime and Netflix. After 5 minutes the connection had dropped to fair and it wouldn't connect to the internet.I looked at all of the suggestions to help with the connection status (published by Amazon) and realized it was all an attempt to gaslight owners of the 4k into thinking the problem is with their router (move the router closer, add a repeater, connect with ethernet cable, blah, blah, blah). Two other older devices connect to my router with great success, but the latest 4k stick is having issues.DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE. The Wifi hardware in the device is bad and Amazon won't admit that they have a bad product.Wait for the next generation and hope they get it right.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2022","Desert Lion",484

Quality of pic is good. Remote is very response and added plus to have volume control finally. I gave it four stars since I really wish Amazon would redesign the stick itself. It is annoying to fit it in properly to the tv ports or if my tv is flat on the wall. The additional connector just makes it stick out from the side and just gets in the way and looks unprofessional. This needs a different design.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2022","JewlzieB",484

Consistent streaming issues, always saying my internet connection is slow, or not connected. Constant interruptions during streaming.I've called support, they taught me how to update the stick and also to restart it. It helps for a short time (sometimes a few days, sometimes not at all).I blamed it on having crappy internet (even though I have the highest speed possible), until last night. I got fed up and disconnected it from my TV, using only the TVs internet connection, and now everything works fine, no streaming issues and apps respond immediately.The user interface is great, but I won't use or purchase again until they troubleshoot the connection issues.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2022","Elisha",484
"Nice upgrade from the 2nd gen","My 2nd gen (refurbished, IIRC) lasted 3 years, so I got my $$ worth. The 4k stick is a significant upgrade. Processes faster for better streaming quality and more efficient in general. Alexa voice control is much better and doesn't lag like my 2nd gen did. Volume and on/off controls (mostly) eliminate the need for my TV remote and the shortcut buttons at the bottom are very useful with Netflix, Hulu, Prime and Disney+. My only complaint is there doesn't seem to be a sleep timer like my two Insignia Fire TVs have, so that's the only purpose my Vizio remote serves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2022","AGon7",484

But I was on the phone with her for 90 minutes before I managed to get it working. We have a separate receiver for our Sony smart TV. And it is set up so that all inputs go through the receiver to the TV (even video). So even after we finally got the video to show correctly, we had a hard time figuring out how to get the audio correct. It kept wanting to use our DirectV audio. Anyway, it finally works!!

Someone complained somewhere that you can’t switch tv inputs with this but I found, by accident, that it does work 1 way on my tv.

I've bought several over the years and the most recent one I bought is noticeably different. To be quite honest, it feels like it was made with wet paper. Every time I press a button I'm fully expecting the remote to completely crumble. And on top of that the price is double what it was just a few short years ago. I'm not impressed at all. Come on Amazon get your act together. I remember when manufacturers and sellers used to be proud of their products. Unfortunately we live in a different world.

If I relied on it for my own streaming, I’d return it for that reason.

Unfortunately this unit stopped working after only 3 months of use. When we reached out to Amazon after doing some trouble shooting we were offered a replacement. The replacement arrived quickly but to our disappointment a 3 month old item was replaced with a refurbished item. So we have a defective unit and we get someone else's defective unit as a replacement. The replacement we could not get the remote to pair up with the refurbished unit and support indicated that the remote must also be bad and are sending a new one which will take 6 days to get here.

"The price is very low to purchase the Amazon Fire Stick 4K with latest Alexa Voice Remote","We purchased an Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device with latest Alexa Voice Remote. It was very easy to set up. We used to have cable TV, then Dish Network, and last, we had Directv. We don't have any of those anymore because they were getting too expensive. So, we now only have (YOU TUBE TV) we have a smart tv plugged into the fire stick. So, purchasing the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device with Alexa Voice Remote was the best decision we ever made! We love how you can ask Alexa to tune to whatever channel you want to watch. But Alexa doesn't understand channel numbers. So, you have to ask Alexa to Tune to (such as) CBS for channel 4 or like to Tune to TCM for channel Turner Classic Movies; and so on. We also can use the Alexa Voice Remote to get to other choices like Netflix and other choices of streaming services to watch. We also like how our new Amazon Fire Stick 4K streaming device with Alexa; controls all of our remotes. We used to have to have one remote to turn on and off the tv; one remote to turn on and off our sound bar; and still another remote to turn on and off Directv. Now Alexa remote turns all of them on and off; besides changing channels; volume control, and recording programs, movies; tv shows, and then by playing them back and you can use the fire stick remote to fast forward past the commercials by only one remote from our Amazon Fire Stick 4K streaming device with Alexa remote! You only have to record one time. then Alexa remote will just keep recording all of the streaming that you record it to do. The remote can also stream music channels to listen too.

This was only $29.00, on sale from $40.00, so maybe there are better ones out there. When I ask Alexa to do something, it takes me somewhere totally different.

"FireTV stick 4K was delivered defective and Amazons response was 15% off next one I buy","FireTV stick 4K was delivered defective and never worked, no registration information or applications were ever downloaded, a 3 second fire tv logo is the only thing it would do... I tried searching online for a possible quick fix but the only option left was calling Amazons tech support and after an hour on the phone, nothing worked...unplug, wait10 minutes, plug back up, restart....change out adapter...change batteries...factory reset...etc... After being put on hold for another long period as he spoke to his supervisor, his response was that I needed to purchase another Firestick 4K with a 15% ...I thought this situation would have been made right by offering to send me a replacement Firestick 4K and a return postage box for the defective product...that way Amazons Quality Control could inspect and verify that it wouldn't boot up beyond the initial firetv logo...I guess it's just more convenient for them to resort to ""plausible deniability"" on their end and ignore my petty grievances as just someone trying to scam them for free merchandise or that through my own my error that made it defective. I've had 6 Firesticks over the past few years, mostly because of the generation upgrades and never have I experienced an issue like this... I've spent a great deal of time researching online for a solution...a great deal of time waiting on hold to speak to an Amazon representative...where I have to speak slow and simple English because it's to a foreign call center....constantly having to ask the technician to repeat because of accent or the limited basic vocabulary, especially having to translate technical terms all while being put on hold for lengthy periods of time made it extremely challenging...if not for optimistic hopes of possibly solving this problem soon then my patience would have gotten the best of me...Amazon failed in it's responsibility of ensuring quality service and product. I can assure you, my time invested in trying to make this right would equal 4 times the value in price I paid expecting a fully functioning Firestick 4K...and what aggravates me the most is that Amazon shows no effort in providing good customer service or responsibility in the quality of their products....Is it my integrity being questioned by some gaslighting Amazon employee over a 35 dollar transaction they failed to honor? dayKeep th' change, my integrity ain't for sale.Good day to you","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2022","Patrick Rice",488
"Nothing To Write Home About","This is my 4th Firestick. They seem to have very short shelf lives. I like that this version has shortcut buttons on the remote for apps like Netflix, Hulu, etc. I’m just disappointed that my data wasn’t transferred to the new stick, something I was prompted to agree to as I made my purchase. It was pretty annoying to have to reenter all my email/passwords. The remote is still very small and very easy to lose. The quality of the picture has improved though.

"Great for What It Does, But BEWARE INTERNET OVERAGES","As much as anyone else, I can say that I like this streaming device. It playbacks in great quality and it has everything you need to stream your favorite apps. Where the problem lies is with the amount of internet it uses. This is something Amazon won't tell you, but any of their streaming sticks throttle your wifi into itself. In just six hours total of using the stick, my family used up around 60% of our allowed data and we pay for 1.5TB of data. Not only that, but whenever it's on, it runs down the speed of every other device in the house. As of now, we've disabled the 4K quality and put it down to the weakest option. I haven't noticed a change in quality, but the internet usage has dropped tremendously. It still throttles quite a bit, but only around 35% a month.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2022","Dawson",489

If you try to fast forward during a commercial, it will go into buffer mode from3-36 seconds. An hour show takes one hour, 45 minutes to 2 hours to watch. I have tried watching several recorded shows, and this happens every time.Update.

You cannot make it bigger but you can make a huge box appear in the middle of the screen that makes it bigger - however it makes the menu far less navigable. Once you get into the specific apps (e.g., Prime Video, Netflix) the font is the normal size for those apps so not a huge deal.

If you have other streaming networks that you pay for it also plays those. You just have to download them under the app section and downloading the apps are free. Once downloaded, then just sign in and now you can watch what ever streaming networks you are paying for. The 4K part is really good. Not every show is in 4k though. Buy even if it's not in 4K the picture quality is still in 1080p HD. The Alexa part is very good as well. My wife and I love this Amazon Firestick 4K and definitely recommend it.

Every so often, I get lost in the work flow of the device between its home mode (Firestick) and what is has and my YouTubeTV streaming app, with all the latter's content and 85+ channel live TV lineup. I can't compare it to ChromeCast or other devices, but I don't think you will be dissatisfied with it once you become accustomed to it. If you have a family member who needs the ultimate simplify of a very intuitive interface (i.e. computer challenged) , this device (and perhaps some others) may be a bit much for them. But to be fair, you may be able to set up a profile for them specifically that makes navigation much more simple by limiting content to what they only want.

The Fire Stick mute button connects directly to the TV so it does not matter what videos are streaming.2) After using the ONN. for several months the ONN. upgraded its firmware.

"I like it better than Roku.","One thing I don't like about Fire TV is if you have super fast internet as I do, the 2 Fire TV sticks one with 4k and one without as with the Roku TV I have has an occasional buffering problem which can cause a lag. This only happens once in a while and I still like Fire TV and do save a lot of money each month over cable or satellite tv. I think the processors they use or the memory buffers they use still aren't quite there yet to keep up with 100 mbs or faster internet speeds. Since I have had the exact same problem with all 3 streaming media devices I have used and tried several solutions to the problem which haven't worked then this is most likely the problem. Perhaps it doesn't happen with other types of streaming media devices but I'm not going to buy anymore at this point and hopefully technology will improve. Overall I still like the Fire TV stick over Roku because Roku doesn't have an internet browser and Fire TV does.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2022","nighthawk",494

The new firestick is doing what a lot of the new TVs are doing, tweaking brightness and color so much that it is ruining movies that I have been watching for years that I loved and making them practically unwatchable. They have made greens, yellows, and sometimes reds garish and overly bright, they have made the images either too dark or too washed out and I can't fix it on my monitor. I have the brightness down to zero and it's still to bright and that's not right. It makes me want to go back to cable it's so messed up. I think it also messed up my old firestick that I loved with an update so now it is too bright. The colors are just all off. I don't know what Amazon is trying to do but this cannot be a sellable product if it is ruining movies.

"Doesn't always fully integrate with ""smart TVs""","It does almost everything the television remote can, including changing the volume of the soundbar and powering on/off, however you have to use the television remote in order to select the firestick in the first place. So you need both remotes no matter what. I'm not sure if this carries over to other televisions, but it's something that can be improved on. I use Roku, so you'd expect everything to just work out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2022","James Siene",498

"Incredible quality & so simple to use!","I was a bit intimidated about cutting the cable cord & streaming but this fire stick was one of the simplest things I've done. It pretty much was self installing & the picture on my older smart tv was never this good - it's amazing!! I do not have Alexa so I can't rate the voice recognition or integration but I can highly recommend this product & tell you it's one of the best things I've ever purchased!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2021","DSSW",498
"Excellent upgrade from Fire TV stick","This is a great upgrade to my previous FireTv stick (Gen 2 non 4K version). The picture quality on this one is so much better and audio quality is superb. The dialogue enhancer and consistent volume functions that were not available on my previous one are superb.More importantly it runs smoothly (my old one was started to hang sometime, may be because of the consistent use for years).I am happy with the purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2021","Roopesh Singh",498
"small and easy to hold","I really like that we are able to watch Free TV with this. Just wish advertisements wouldn't pop up all the time and I still not sure if I can actually skip any ads. I see the word skip on the lower right hand corner but haven't a clue as to how to skip them. I have tried different things but so far, nothing seems to let me skip them.Other than that, I am very satisfied with my Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device with latest Alexa Voice Remote.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2021","dukeanika",498
"Disappointing","So disappointed in this device. It was challenging to set up (I’m old, so take that with a grain of salt), but I finally got it working only to discover the picture is very dark. I’ve researched possible causes and solutions, and none of them have worked for me. I have discovered that this seems to be a fairly common problem with the Fire Stick. Additionally, I have to keep signing in to my Apps, which is a pain. I also find the navigation through menus to be clunky and annoying. I could tolerate all that if the picture quality was decent, which it’s not. Perhaps if you are more tech savvy the Fire Stick will work fine, but for me it’s just a a huge disappointment.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2022","Lauren C.

"Works great for my TV so I can use YouTubeTV","The ""dish"" company, after 30? years wouldn't give me the deal they gave to new customers so I cancelled and went to YouTubeTV, I needed the Fire TV Stick to download the apps to my TV (older TV) and it has worked great. There are some interesting things that aren't ideal and I'm still learning on how to use it, setup the channels, etc. but overall I'm happy with the streaming, etc. I don't have the fastest internet speeds at my house (20mps) but I haven't noticed any degradation of picture quality, etc.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2021","Kevin McIntyre",498
"Stick of Fire Hired","I wish someone told me that I needed a newer FireTV to access AppleTV+, instead I hardly used that streaming service.

But otherwise we have not had any other issues.Make the move and upgrade your fire stick!!!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2022","Sweet Mable Ann",499
"Horrible experience","Hands down one of the worst experiences I’ve ever had. I bought this, trusting amazons direct product, only to be extremely disappointed. IT WILL NOT CONNECT WITH REMOTE. I tried all the trouble shooting in the book, then on this app, then on YouTube. Still not working. I called and explained that I ordered this so I have tv when I move 8 hours away. They say they can’t help me because they can’t ship me a replacement or refund because my info wasn’t updated. I’ve been a prime member for a LONG time, and order stuff ALL THE TIME. I have a horrible taste in my mouth about it currently. Not to mention, I explained I was frustrated, and the customer service agent seemed to think it was funny, and make sly remarks. If I could leave less stars I would.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2022","Michael Lalonde",499
"Hard to set up and pushes Amazon","Everything did what it was supposed to do. However, took a long time to figure it out. I was looking for something that was simple and straight-forward (kind of like Roku), where all the apps were clearly visible and easy to find. I also wanted something that would make connection with the other services easy to set up. I had a particularly hard time finding YouTubeTV and setting it up. It's like they had to support it, but didn't really want to.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2022","Amazon Customer",499
"Not for live TV","I have had it for 3 months now. I steam live TV and I watch a lot of sports. The Firestick freezes up when streaming live TV. At first I thought maybe it’s my internet but I have a small smart TV in a room upstairs on a WiFi connection and it never freezes up while the Firestick is downstairs sitting 12 inches from the router and freezes up every single time. This is my second Firestick, I was hoping the newer model would work better. If you only stream prerecorded material like Netflix it works good but occasionally the app will freeze and when you exit the app it does not close it. If the app freezes you have to unplug the Firestick to restart the app, but to be fair this is minimal. Over all if you want to stream live TV spend the money to get a smart TV or be prepared for the frustration of it freezing, usually at the most critical part of the game.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2022","Clyde",499
"Not easy to install","It is a big upgrade from the one I purchased 8 years ago but not easy to install and integrate with Firebox DVR. Called the help line and a real person answered. Unfortunately, they were no help and wanted me to use Alexa to figure it out. In the end, I rebooted everything, and it worked. It also seems to phase a lot and seems to be re-started a fair amount, frustrating.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2022","T McCann",499
"Works great. (Can get lost in your couch)","Works really well and I like the updated buttons that take you straight to Disney+ or Netflix. Nice feature. Amazon should add a vibrate or alarm signal on the their remotes for when you may lose them. That's my idea for ya!As a fix we attached ours to a string attached to the couch so we can't lose it anymore. It's so sleek and small it dives into cracks like that old penny and Cheeto you lost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2022","Amazon Customer",499
